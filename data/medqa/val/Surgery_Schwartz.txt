Sur-gery conferences can tag tweets by using a prespecified hashtag (i.e., #SurgeryConference) to denote conference-related messages. These can then be tracked. A mention occurs when a user includes another user’s name in the tweet. Note in the example that even if there are only a few users tweeting about a conference, the number of impressions can be large if several of those users have a large number of followers. For example, @User13 only tweeted 13 times but had 103,937 impressions.educational purposes. They are examples of crowdsourcing whereby information is gathered by enlisting the assistance of a large number of participants. Crowdsourcing often involves the general public or a loosely defined group of individuals as opposed to outsourcing, which tasks a project to a specific company or group. For example, Wikipedia is an example of crowdsourcing. In surgery, an example of crowdsourcing are the web-based communities formed by the American College of Surgeons. Members can belong to one or more communities which are based on specialty (i.e., general surgery or endocrine surgery), geography (i.e., Florida Chapter), level of education (i.e., medical students or senior surgeons), special interest (i.e., surgeon writers), or issue (i.e., quality improvement and advo-cacy). Members can post and respond to discussion threads that cover a wide range of topics including advice for challenging cases, surgical history, and political issues.An example of a social media–based interactive forum is the International Hernia Collaboration (IHC) which is housed on Facebook. Participants include not only surgeons but also healthcare providers and industry representatives interested in improving outcomes after hernia surgery. Membership in the IHC is limited to those who have been vetted and approved. The forum allows members to ask for advice on difficult cases, debate controversial topics, post step-by-step instructions on procedures or management strategies, and disseminate informa-tion rapidly to a wide audience. Collaborative forums such as the IHC allow for real-time, interactive, case-based, continuing education.Public EducationThe educational opportunities provided by the internet and social media are not limited to healthcare providers. The inter-net and social media are also being increasingly used to educate patients and their families. There are multiple media through which health education is spread, including, but not limited to, online or social media discussion forums run by patients, patient support groups, healthcare providers, or healthcare orga-nizations; blogs or newsrooms; or electronic and mobile health patient portals. Social media allows patients rapid access to information regardless of time or location. However, as noted in the following section, the accuracy of social media–based educational materials cannot be guaranteed, and patients should utilize caution in relying on the information to make important healthcare decisions.PITFALLS IN WEB AND SOCIAL MEDIA–BASED EDUCATIONDespite the many advantages of web and social media–based education, significant potential pitfalls still remain. First, widespread adoption and utilization is a challenge. Although internet and mobile phone usage is prevalent, effec-tiveness of web-based educational materials is dependent upon trainees’ and surgeons’ uptake of the technology and available resources. Despite increasing availability of the internet and mobile technology, not all surgeons use it for educational pur-poses. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Guraya et al found that three out of four medical students use social networking sites, but only one out of five uses them for educational purposes. Furthermore, lack of utilization can impact educational effectiveness. In the previously mentioned multicenter trial comparing a moderated journal club to an online version, low participation in the Internet journal club was postulated to be a significant factor in the poorer perfor-mance on a critical appraisal test. More attention to instruc-tional design may improve uptake and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Cook et al determined that features such as interactivity, practice exercises, repeti-tion, and feedback are associated with improved learning out-comes. The authors also noted that the evidence base upon which to design internet-based learning programs is limited by poor study methodology, failure to use conceptual frame-works, and lack of adherence to reporting standards. Thus, while the aforementioned features should be considered in designing future web and social media–based educational pro-grams, further evidence-based guidance is needed.Second, the quality of information available online and via social media may not be accurate or reliable. Multiple reports have been published regarding the inaccuracies of web-based educational materials. Surgeons and surgical trainees should carefully evaluate the source of educational material, search for conflicts of interest that may result in biased information, assess how recently the information was updated, and cross-check references. The lay public may have more difficulty in identifying trustworthy surgical educational materials on the internet. Healthcare providers should guide patients to reputable websites and to encourage discussion regarding the accuracy of the content.Third, useful dialog and advice about difficult cases must be balanced with ethical considerations surrounding patient con-fidentiality and privacy. Appropriate safeguards must be taken 7Brunicardi_Ch54_p2187-p2196.indd   219213/02/19   2:37 PM 2193WEB-BASED EDUCATION AND IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIACHAPTER 54Table 54-2The American College of Physicians Ethics, Professionalism and Human Rights Committee; the American College of Physicians Council of Associates; and the Federation of State Medical Boards Special Committee on Ethics and Professionalism published a position paper on online medical professionalismPosition 1Use of online media can bring significant educational benefits to patients and physicians, but it may also pose ethical challenges. Maintaining trust in the profession and in patient–physician relationships requires that physicians consistently apply ethical principles for preserving the relationship, confidentiality, privacy, and respect for persons to online settings and communications.Position 2The boundaries between professional and social spheres can blur online. Physicians should keep the two spheres separate and comport themselves professionally in both.Position 3Email or other electronic communications should only be used by physicians in an established patient–physician relationship and with patient consent. Documentation about patient care communications should be included in the patient’s medical record.Position 4Physicians should consider periodically “self-auditing” to assess the accuracy of information available about them on physician-ranking websites and other sources online.Position 5The reach of the internet and online communications is far and often permanent. Physicians, trainees, and medical students should be aware that online postings may have future implications for their professional lives.Data from Farnan JM1, Snyder Sulmasy L, Worster BK, et al: Online medical professionalism: patient and public relationships: policy statement from the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards, Ann Intern Med. 2013 Apr 16;158(8):620-627.to ensure that patients cannot be identified based on provided information, that patients have consented to have their informa-tion posted anonymously, and that all case-related comments are appropriate and professional. While common sense should be utilized in posting about patient cases, only a few organizations have published guidelines for how to safeguard against potential pitfalls. In 2013, the American College of Physicians Ethics, Professionalism, and Human Rights Committee; the American College of Physicians Council of Associates; and the Federa-tion of State Medical Boards Special Committee on Ethics and  Professionalism published a position statement about online medical education (Table 54-2). The paper stated that “Maintain-ing trust in the profession and in patient–physician relationships requires that physicians consistently apply ethical principles for preserving the relationship, confidentiality, privacy, and respect for persons to online settings and communications.”Fourth, conflicts of interest must be clearly stated. Jour-nals require authors to declare relevant conflicts of interest, but multiple studies suggest that these often go unreported. Simi-larly, conflicts of interest should be disclosed on social media. However, such disclosures may be more difficult on social media due to the limited number of allowable characters (i.e., 140 characters for Twitter) or to the way information is propa-gated. For example, a surgeon may disclose an industry relation-ship on an original tweet, but the disclosure may not appear in subsequent comments of a discussion thread. Surgeons post-ing on social media must make it their ethical and professional obligation to disclose their conflicts of interest. Furthermore, users of social media content must be aware of the potential for bias introduced by undisclosed conflicts of interest and per-form due diligence in assessing the reliability of the source. Lastly, regulatory bodies and professional organizations should publish standardized guidelines for disclosing on social media or develop mechanisms by which disclosure can be publicly accessed (such as the Open Payments database).Fifth, professionalism must always be maintained. Sur-geons posting content on the web or on social media must be aware that information will be widely disseminated and avail-able for posterity; messages posted on social media cannot be fully retracted. As already mentioned, surgeons must strive to maintain patient privacy, ensure accuracy of information, and disclose conflicts of interest. Furthermore, surgeons must be aware of unintentional interpretations of messages (i.e., as discriminatory or unprofessional). Multiple studies of health-care providers’ social media sites have identified potentially and clearly unprofessional content; these studies have included medical students, residents, and practicing surgeons. Despite the prevalence of unprofessional content, few surgical residency programs have formal institutional social media policies. Fur-thermore, the American College of Physicians and Federation of State Medical Boards position statement only addresses a few of the issues surrounding web-based activities including for patient and physician education (Table 54-3).Table 54-3Online medical professionalism and educationPOSITIONS ON PROFESSIONALISM IN ONLINE PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION•	The Internet can be a powerful tool for education.•	Physicians should guide patients to high quality online resources that are accurate and objective. These sites should have peer-reviewed content or have verifiable mechanisms for quality control of information.•	Online resources for learning can be used by patients and physicians.•	The internet and social networking can be used to improve public health. Physicians engaged in online communities should ensure the security of the networks and restriction of participation to verified users. Clinical scenarios should not contain any personal identifying information, and patient consent should be obtained before sharing the vignette.•	Discussion of frustrations online undermines trust and professionalism and should be avoided.Data from Farnan JM1, Snyder Sulmasy L, Worster BK, et al: Online medical professionalism: patient and public relationships: policy statement from the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards, Ann Intern Med. 2013 Apr 16;158(8):620-627.Brunicardi_Ch54_p2187-p2196.indd   219313/02/19   2:37 PM 2194SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IILastly, studies evaluating the effectiveness of web-based education have had varied results. A recent systematic review by Taveira-Gomes et al assessed 251 articles using computer-based learning methodologies in medical education; the num-ber of articles on this topic has increased over time. The most commonly used metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of these methodologies were assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The majority of studies reported positive effects on these outcomes, although the more rigorous studies (i.e., randomized trials) were less likely to find a positive effect. Online activ-ity (i.e., number of posts or views) was tracked in a few stud-ies, but results were conflicting regarding whether increased engagement correlated with improved performance. This review suggests that high-quality studies are needed of web-based edu-cational interventions and that these studies need to include measures of clinical performance and outcomes.IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe Society of University Surgeons’ Social and Legislative Committee issued a position statement entitled: “Social media is a necessary component of surgery practice.” Given the rapid pace with which technology is advancing and the familiar-ity of the current generation (Generation Z) with the inter-net, surgeons have no choice but to harness the power of the internet and social media or risk being left behind. Many jour-nals are phasing out print versions, and several journals are already online only. Furthermore, textbooks may also become a relic from the past as publishers move towards developing digi-tal versions that include interactive graphics, audio, and video.As surgical education continues to evolve, future directions may include broader indications for utilization of weband social media-based resources. For example, video-based coaching with face-to-face discussions have been used postoperatively to sup-plement intraoperative teaching. However, preoperative crowd-sourcing in planning a challenging case or intraoperative video telementoring are other applications of video-based coaching.Future research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective formats and components of web and social media–based educational interventions, using rigorous methods to compare educational methods, and measuring clinical out-comes. Moreover, standardized guidelines should be instituted in order to safeguard against ethical and professional misconduct.BIBLIOGRAPHYBirkmeyer JD, Finks JF, O’Reilly A, Oerline M, et al; Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative.
