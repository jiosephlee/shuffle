Commercial preparation courses can be helpful for some students, but such courses are typically expensive and require significant time commitment. They are usually effective in organizing study material for students who feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material involved in Step 2 CK preparation. Note that multiweek courses may be quite intense and may thus leave limited time for independent study. Also note that some commercial courses are designed for first-time test takers while others focus on students who are repeating the exam. In addition, some courses are geared toward IMGs who want to take all three Steps in a limited amount of time.

Student experience and satisfaction with review courses are highly variable. We suggest that you discuss options with recent graduates of the review courses you are considering. In addition, course content and structure can change rapidly. Some student opinions can be found in discussion groups on the World Wide Web. Listed below is contact information for some Step 2 CK commercial review courses.
