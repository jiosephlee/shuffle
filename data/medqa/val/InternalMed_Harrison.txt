 stages of the testing process, from specimen collection to result interpretation. An error arising at any stage may adversely affect patient care. In clinical laboratory practice, it is customary to divide the testing process into three phases: preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic. Examples of each type of error are shown in Table 480e-3. The most common error in the testing process is specimen mislabeling, in which a specimen from one patient is placed in a container labeled with another patient’s name or identifiers. Specimen mislabeling errors may have very serious consequences for a patient. For example, if erroneous typing of a patient’s blood group results from specimen mislabeling and is followed by transfusion of a mismatched unit of blood, the outcome may be fatal. A mislabeled biopsy specimen can lead either to an erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate therapy or to a failure to make a diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy.

In addition to errors, many preanalytic factors can influence clinical laboratory results. Posture (i.e., recumbent versus upright), exercise, diet, recently ingested food, and use of prescribed or recreational drugs (including tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and herbal supplements) can influence a variety of analyte concentrations. After blood has been collected, certain analytes undergo changes in their concentration during storage or transportation. Glucose levels fall as a result of red cell metabolism. Ammonia levels rise as a result of protein breakdown. Increasing permeability and breakdown of red cell membranes leads to increases in plasma potassium and free hemoglobin levels. Bacterial contamination can lead to overgrowth of specimens. To minimize tabLe 480e-3 exaMpLeS of preaNaLytiC, aNaLytiC, aNd poStaNaLytiC errorS duriNg the Laboratory teStiNg proCeSS

Preanalytic Sources of Error

Important clinical information not provided Delays in transportation to the lab, leading to alterations in specimen constituents

Analytic Sources of Error

Incorrect storage conditions prior to analysis Specimen misidentification in the laboratory Wrong test performed Assay interferences Assay failure (e.g., assay out of control)

Postanalytic Sources of Error

Delay in communication of assay results Results not communicated to correct person Incorrect result communicated Misinterpretation of result these precollection alterations, specimens should be processed or transported to the clinical laboratory as soon as possible after collection. The list of known preanalytic variables and their effects is extensive, and the reader is referred to the compendium on this subject (see Young DS: Effects of Preanalytical Variables on Clinical Laboratory Tests, 3rd ed. Washington, DC, AACC Press, 2007).

The great majority of tests continue to be performed in dedicated clinical laboratory facilities, but for several decades there has been a trend toward point-of-care testing. This change has been made possible by the development of portable analytic devices, including single-purpose instruments such as glucometers and oxygen saturation monitors, and multifunction instruments that can perform a wider variety of analyses, particularly in chemistry and hematology but also in some areas of microbiology. The use of these devices is driven largely by the convenience of faster result availability. In some settings (e.g., in rural areas and developing countries), there may be no easily accessible clinical laboratory and a point-of-care device may be the best or only option for testing. However, the per-specimen cost of point-of-care testing, in terms both of reagents and supplies and of personnel, is often greater than that of centralized testing. Other concerns relate to the adequacy of personnel training for point-of-care testing, the quality of the results, and the incorporation of results into the medical record.

One of the largest markets for point-of-care testing is home testing by patients, which has long been an important element in the management of persons with diabetes who monitor their own blood glucose levels. Over-the-counter kits for home pregnancy testing have been available for decades. More recently, kits have become available for home testing of the international normalized ratio or prothrombin time by patients taking oral anticoagulants. Kits are also available for cholesterol monitoring, fecal occult-blood detection, and hemoglobin measurement. In these areas, there is often little information on the quality of test performance, the accuracy of the results, or the correctness of result interpretation.

The principles of genetic medicine in clinical practice are dis cussed in Chaps. 82–84. Here we will concentrate on issues related to clinical laboratory testing for genetic disease.

The distinction between genetic testing for inherited disorders and that for acquired disorders affects the type of tissue that should be obtained for analysis. In inherited disorders, all nucleated cells are expected to carry the inherited mutation; thus white blood cells or buccal cells (obtained by scraping the inside of the cheek) are convenient sources of DNA for clinical laboratory testing. For prenatal testing of the fetus, chorionic villi or amniocytes are commonly used. In tests for acquired genetic disorders (e.g., in tumors), the tissue of interest that contains a suspected mutation must be sampled. It is often useful to compare tumor DNA with the patient’s normal DNA in order to identify acquired mutations (e.g., testing for microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer; Chap. 101e).

Although it is assumed that all clinical laboratory testing is performed with the consent of the patient (or, in the case of minors, the parents), regulations may require formal written consent for genetic testing. Such regulations vary among jurisdictions, and the practicing clinician should be aware of local regulations. In some jurisdictions, there are regulations on the storage and use of genetic information and on the maximal period for which genetic specimens may be stored.

For some late-onset genetic diseases, such as Huntington’s disease (Chap. 449), genetic testing allows a prediction about the future development of the disease. The degree of certainty that is possible on the basis of this testing surpasses that associated with identifica-480e-5 tion of more traditional disease risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia as a risk factor for future myocardial infarction). When deciding to undertake predictive genetic testing, it is important for the patient to consider the broad implications of a positive or negative test result, to be made aware of any support and counseling that is available, and to understand the implications of a result for other family members. In dealing with these issues, genetic counselors play an important role (Chap. 84). Their expertise includes the ability to explain genetic disorders at an understandable level to patients and their families, to arrange for support services, and to provide genetic risk assessments to members of families with genetic disorders.

When testing for genetic disorders, the clinical laboratory will use different analytic approaches according to the disease of interest. Some disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, are caused by single-point mutations. Testing for these disorders involves mere assessment for one or a few mutations in a single gene. Other disorders (e.g., hyperphenylalaninemias) may be caused by numerous mutations in a single gene. Still others (e.g., hereditary breast cancer) may be caused by mutations in many genes. The number of possible mutations and genes that underlie a clinical phenotype affects the cost of and time required for clinical laboratory testing as well as the likelihood of finding a disease-causing mutation.

If a disease phenotype can be caused by many mutations, a clinical laboratory result that is negative should be interpreted with care. For example, it is common to screen healthy pregnant women (and their partners) for mutations in the CFTR gene, which is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this screening is to identify women who are carriers of a CFTR mutation and therefore are at increased risk of having a baby with CF. Because CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, a fetus has a 1:4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers of disease-causing CFTR mutations. The screening test approach that is commonly used to identify mutations in carriers detects 80–85% of all known disease-causing CFTR mutations in Caucasians and up to 97% of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews. A negative screening result therefore does not completely eliminate the possibility that a woman (or her partner) actually has a mutation. What can be inferred from a negative test result is that the risk of having a CF-affected baby has decreased significantly to an extent that depends on the woman’s ethnic group and the mutations that were examined. The clinical laboratory should calculate and report the woman’s new risk of being a carrier if the screening result is negative.

The increasing availability of large-scale (next-generation) sequencing of a patient’s whole genome or exome will greatly affect genetic testing over the next decade, with implications for the number of mutations that can be detected and the increased complexity of result interpretation.

Genetic testing has limitations that are often unique to this field. Results may be inconclusive. For example, a search for mutations in a gene that is suspected of causing a disease may fail to reveal any known disease-causing mutations. A mutation may be discovered that is of unknown clinical significance. In this situation, consideration of the predicted change in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein may suggest a biologic effect—e.g., replacement of a charged amino acid by one of the opposite charge or by a neutral amino acid; replacement of an amino acid by one of a different size; or replacement of an amino acid that is conserved across multiple species. Further information may be obtained by determining whether the mutation is found in healthy individuals. Even with all of these considerations, it is not uncommon that the biologic significance of an identified mutation remains uncertain, and further research may be needed to assess its significance.

It is also important to understand the limitations of the clinical laboratory approach used to detect mutations. At this time, next-generation sequencing remains an impractical undertaking for financial reasons, although extensive sequence analysis has become the

Chapter 480e The Clinical Laboratory in Modern Health Care standard of care for a few genes (e.g., analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in assessing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in individuals with a strong family history of these disorders). As sequencing technologies become less expensive, they can be expected to be more commonly used for both identifying mutations in patients with genetic disorders and screening asymptomatic individuals at risk of genetic disease.

Another unique aspect of genetic testing is the concern that genetic information about individuals may be used to discriminate against them by employers or by insurance companies. In the United States, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits the use of genetic information by employers in making decisions related to employment and by health insurance companies in issuing insurance policies or setting premium rates based on knowledge of the applicant’s genetic status. GINA does not cover disability insurance, long-term care insurance, or life insurance policies.

Although public attention has been most closely focused on DNA testing, other clinical laboratory investigations that are not usually thought of as genetic may provide important genetic information about the person being tested. For example, serum protein electrophoresis may reveal α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Depending on the clinical laboratory technology used, measurement of hemoglobin A1C, commonly used for monitoring diabetes control, may reveal a hemoglobin variant such as HbS (sickle cell). Measurement of cholesterol and triglyceride levels may reveal any of a number of hereditary disorders. All of these results are types of genetic information.

In the United States, all clinical laboratory testing performed for clinical purposes (but not for research purposes) is regulated by the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Act of 1988 (CLIA). Home monitoring by patients who are testing their own specimens is not covered by CLIA. The statute and the regulations, which are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, apply to all laboratories, whether located in a physician’s office, a large hospital, or a reference laboratory; and all laboratories are required to hold a valid CLIA certificate that is appropriate for the highest complexity level of the tests they perform. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for assigning the complexity level of commercial tests. The lowest category of complexity is the “waived” category, which is followed (in order of increasing complexity) by the categories of “provider-performed microscopy,” “moderatecomplexity testing,” and “high-complexity testing.” The category of provider-performed microscopy is used to cover tests such as the use of potassium hydroxide preparations on skin scrapings to examine for fungi, fern tests, and sperm motility tests; it does not encompass histopathology that falls into the high-complexity category. Even if a clinical laboratory is performing only testing in the “waived” category, it must still hold a valid CLIA certificate. Laboratories that hold certificates for nonwaived tests are required to participate in proficiency testing and are regularly inspected to monitor their performance.
