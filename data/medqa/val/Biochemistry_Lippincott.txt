 size (folate and B12 deficiencies) or decreased RBC size (iron and vitamin C deficiencies). In hemolytic anemias, such as is seen in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase deficiencies and in sickle cell anemia, RBC size typically is normal, and RBC number is decreased.

Case 4: Rapid Heart Rate, Headache, and Sweating with a Pheochromocytoma

Answer = D. Degradation of both epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE) involves methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) that produces normetanephrine from NE and metanephrine from epinephrine (see figure at right). Both of these products are deaminated to vanillylmandelic acid by monoamine oxidase (MAO). The substrate for the synthesis of the catecholamines is tyrosine, which gets hydroxylated to 3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tetrahydrobiopterin-requiring tyrosine hydroxylase. DOPA is converted to dopamine by a pyridoxal phosphate– requiring decarboxylase. [Note: Most carboxylases require biotin.] NE is converted to epinephrine by methylation, and S-adenosylmethionine provides the methyl group.

Answer = A. NE released from the sympathetic nervous system functions as a neurotransmitter that acts on postsynaptic neurons and causes, for example, increased heart rate. It is also released from the adrenal medulla and, along with epinephrine, functions as a counterregulatory hormone that results in mobilization of stored fuels (for example, glucose and triacylglycerols). These actions are mediated by the binding of NE to adrenergic receptors, which are G protein–coupled receptors of the plasma membrane, and not to nuclear receptors like those of steroid hormones or membrane tyrosine kinase receptors like that of insulin. Septic shock is vasodilatory hypotension (low blood pressure caused by blood vessel dilation) resulting from the production of large amounts of nitric oxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase in response to infection. NE bound to receptors on smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction and, thus, raises blood pressure.

Case 5: Sun Sensitivity with Xeroderma Pigmentosum

Answer = D. Pyrimidine dimers are the characteristic DNA lesions caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Their repair involves the excision of an oligonucleotide containing the dimer and replacement of that oligonucleotide, a process known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). (See figure at right for a representation of the process in prokaryotes.) DNA repair systems are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nothing is error free, but the homologous recombination (HR) method of double-strand break repair is much less prone to error than is the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) method because any DNA that was lost is replaced. Mismatched-base repair (MMR) involves identification and repair of the newly synthesized (daughter) strand. In prokaryotes, the extent of strand methylation is used to discriminate between the strands. Base excision repair (BER), the mechanism by which uracil is removed from DNA, utilizes a glycosylase to remove the base, creating an apyrimidinic or apurinic (AP) site. The sugar-phosphate is then removed by the actions of an endo-and exonuclease.

Answer = A. All replication requires an RNA primer because DNA polymerases (pol) cannot initiate DNA synthesis. The chromatin of eukaryotes gets decondensed (relaxed) for replication. Relaxation can be accomplished, for example, by acetylation via histone acetyltransferases. Prokaryotes have more than one DNA pol. For example, pol III extends the RNA primer with DNA, and pol I removes the primer and replaces it with DNA. Replication is initiated at specific locations (one in prokaryotes, many in eukaryotes) that are recognized by proteins (for example, DnaA in prokaryotes). Deoxynucleoside monophosphates (dNMP) are joined by a phosphodiester bond that links the 3′hydroxyl group of the last dNMP added with the 5′-phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide, thereby forming a 3′→5′-phosphodiester bond as pyrophosphate is released. Proofreading occurs during replication in the S (synthesis of DNA) phase of the cell cycle and involves the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity possessed by some DNA pol (see figure below). Because repair can occur independently of replication, it can be performed outside of the S phase.

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae with

Answer = B. Glutathione in its reduced form (G-SH) is an important antioxidant. The selenium-containing enzyme glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, a reactive oxygen species) to water as glutathionine is oxidized (G-S-S-G). Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)requiring glutathionine reductase regenerates G-SH from G-S-S-G (see Figure A). The NADPH is supplied by the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (see Figure B), which is regulated by the availability of NADPH at the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-catalyzed step (the first step). Deficiency of G6PD occurs in all cells, but the effects are seen in red blood cells where the pentose phosphate pathway is the only source of NADPH. The pathway involves two irreversible oxidative reactions, each of which generates NADPH. The NADPH is used in reductive processes such as fatty acid synthesis (not oxidation) as well as steroid hormone and cholesterol synthesis.

Answer = A. Jaundice (icterus) refers to the yellow color of the skin, nail beds, and sclerae that results from bilirubin deposition when the bilirubin level in the blood is elevated (hyperbilirubinemia; see Image C). Bilirubin has low solubility in aqueous solutions, and its solubility is increased by conjugation with uridine diphosphate–glucuronic acid in the liver, forming bilirubin diglucuronide or conjugated bilirubin (CB). In hemolytic conditions, such as G6PD deficiency, both CB and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) are increased, but it is UCB that is found in the blood. CB is sent into the intestine. Phototherapy is used to treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia because it converts bilirubin to isomeric forms that are more water soluble. Bilirubin is the product of heme degradation in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver and the spleen. The porphyrias are pathologies of heme synthesis and, therefore, are not characterized by hyperbilirubinemia.

With hemolysis, more bilirubin is produced and conjugated. CB is sent to the intestine where it is converted to urobilinogen, some of which is reabsorbed, enters the portal blood, and travels to the kidney. Because the source of urinary urobilinogen is intestinal urobilinogen, urinary urobilinogen will be low in obstructive jaundice because intestinal urobilinogen will be low as a result of the obstruction of the common bile duct (see Figure D).

Case 7: Joint Pain with Gout

Answer = F. Salvage of the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine to the purine nucleotides inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) requires 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as the source of the ribose 1phosphate. Salvage decreases the amount of substrate available for degradation to uric acid. Therefore, a deficiency in salvage results in hyperuricemia (see figure at right). Noncompetitive inhibitors such as oxypurinol have no effect on the Michaelis constant (Km) but decrease the apparent maximal velocity (Vmax).

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug. It has no effect on the enzymes of purine synthesis or degradation. Glutamine (not glutamate) is a nitrogen source for purine ring synthesis. In purine nucleotide synthesis, the purine ring system is constructed on the ribose 5-phosphate provided by PRPP. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase of purine degradation. The amidotransferase is the regulated enzyme of purine synthesis. Its activity is decreased by purine nucleotides and increased by PRPP.

Answer = B. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, decreasing the availability of N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate needed for synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) by thymidylate synthase (see figure at right). Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) II is the regulated enzymic activity of pyrimidine biosynthesis in humans. CPS I is an enzyme of the urea cycle. Orotic aciduria is a rare pathology of pyrimidine synthesis caused by a deficiency in one or both enzymic activities of bifunctional uridine monophosphate synthase. Pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, like purine synthesis and salvage, requires PRPP.

Increased activity of PRPP synthetase results in increased synthesis of PRPP. This results in an increase in purine nucleotide synthesis beyond need. The excess purine nucleotides get degraded to uric acid, thereby causing hyperuricemia.

Case 8: No Bowel Movement with Cystic Fibrosis

Answer = A. The clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) are the consequence of chloride retention with increased water absorption that causes mucus on an epithelial surface to be excessively thick and sticky. The result is pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems such as respiratory infection and impaired exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions (pancreatic insufficiency). Impaired endocrine pancreatic function can result in diabetes with associated hyperglycemia. The genetic testing technique described, and one used in the diagnosis of CF, is the use of allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO). Some mutations do result in increased degradation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, but degradation is initiated by tagging the protein with ubiquitin. Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame through the addition or deletion of nucleotides by a number not divisible by three. Because the ∆F509 mutation is caused by the loss of three nucleotides that code for phenylalanine (F) at position 509 in the CFTR protein, it is not a frameshift mutation. Answer = A. Targeting of proteins destined to function as components of the plasma membrane is an example of cotranslational targeting. It involves the initiation of translation on cytosolic ribosomes; recognition of the amino (N)terminal signal sequence in the protein by the signal recognition particle; movement of the protein-synthesizing complex to the outer face of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); and continuation of protein synthesis, such that the protein is threaded into the lumen of the ER and packaged into vesicles that travel to and through the Golgi and eventually fuse with the plasma membrane. The N-terminal signal sequence is removed by a peptidase in the lumen of the ER. Mannose 6-phosphate is the signal that cotranslationally targets proteins to the matrix of the lysosome where they function as acid hydrolases.

The pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with CF results in a decreased ability to digest food, and digestion is required for absorption. Dietary fats move through the intestine and are excreted in the stool (see figure at right), which is foul-smelling and bulky and may float. Patients are at risk for malnutrition and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins. Oral supplementation of pancreatic enzymes is the treatment.

Case 9: Hyperammonemia with a Urea Cycle Defect

Answer = B. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) cleaves argininosuccinate to arginine (Arg) and fumarate. The increase in argininosuccinate and citrulline and the decrease in Arg seen in RL indicate a deficiency in ASL (see figure below). With arginase deficiency, Arg would be increased, not decreased. Additionally, with arginase deficiency, the hyperammonemia would be less severe because two nitrogens are excreted. Deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) would also cause an increase in citrulline, but argininosuccinate would be low to absent. Deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) I is characterized by low levels of Arg and citrulline. Deficiency of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), the only X-linked enzyme of the urea cycle, would result in low levels of Arg and citrulline and elevated levels of urinary orotic acid. [Note: The orotic acid is elevated because the carbamoyl phosphate (CP) substrate of OTC is being used in the cytosol as a substrate for pyrimidine synthesis.]

Arg supplementation is helpful because the Arg will be hydrolyzed to urea + ornithine by arginase. The ornithine will be combined with CP to form citrulline (see figure above). With ASL (and ASS) deficiency, citrulline accumulates and is excreted, thereby carrying waste nitrogen out of the body. Answer = D. In individuals with milder (partial) deficiencies in the enzymes of the urea cycle, hyperammonemia may be triggered by physiologic stress (for example, an illness or prolonged fasting) that decreases the insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio. [Note: The degree of the hyperammonemia is usually less severe than that seen in the neonatal onset forms.] The shift in the ratio results, in part, in skeletal muscle proteolysis, and the amino acids that are released get degraded. Degradation involves transamination by pyridoxal phosphate–requiring aminotransferases that generate the α-keto acid derivative of the amino acid + glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia (NH3) by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; see figure at right). [Note: GDH is unusual in that it uses both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as coenzymes.]

The NH3, which is toxic, can be transported to the liver as glutamine (Gln) and alanine (Ala). The Gln is generated by the amination of glutamate by ATP-requiring glutamine synthetase. In the liver, the enzyme glutaminase removes the NH3, which can be converted to urea by the urea cycle or excreted as ammonium (NH4+) (see figure at right). Gln, then, is a nontoxic vehicle of NH3 transport in the blood. Ala is generated in skeletal muscle from the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). In the liver, Ala is transaminated by alanine transaminase (ALT) to pyruvate (used in gluconeogenesis) and glutamate. Thus, Ala carries nitrogen to the liver for conversion to urea (see figure below). Therefore, defects in the urea cycle would result in an elevation in NH3, Gln, and Ala. The elevated NH3 drives respiration, and the hyperventilation causes a rise in pH (respiratory alkalosis). [Note: Hyperammonemia is toxic to the nervous system. Although the exact mechanisms are not completely understood, it is known that the metabolism of large amounts of NH3 to Gln (in the astrocytes of the brain) results in osmotic effects that cause the brain to swell. Additionally, the rise in Gln decreases the availability of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter.]

Case 10: Swollen, Painful Calf with Deep Venous Thrombosis

Answer = D. Thrombin, a serine protease, is activated by the prothrombinase complex of factor (F)Xa + FVa. Once formed, activated thrombin (FIIa) proteolytically activates components of the extrinsic (FVII) and intrinsic (FXI, FVIII) pathways, generating FXa. Thrombin can also activate FV, FI, and FXIII of the common pathway (see figure below). Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in FVIII. FIX deficiency results in hemophilia B. FIII, also known as tissue factor (TF), is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the vascular endothelium. It functions as an accessory protein and not a protease. Formation of the platelet plug is primary hemostasis, and formation of the fibrin meshwork is secondary hemostasis. Vitamin K is required for the activation (γ-carboxylation) of FII, FVII, FIX, and FX (proteases that require calcium [Ca2+] and phospholipids [PL]) but not for FI (fibrinogen).

Answer = C. FV Leiden is a mutant form of FV that is resistant to proteolysis by the activated protein C complex. Decreased ability to degrade FV allows continued production of activated thrombin and leads to an increased risk of clot formation or thrombophilia. Antithrombin III (ATIII) and protein S are proteins of anticoagulation. Increased, not decreased, production of prothrombin would result in thrombophilia. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor causes a coagulopathy or a deficiency in clotting through effects on FVIII and platelets. Heparin and warfarin are anticoagulants. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, increases the affinity of ATIII for thrombin. Binding of ATIII removes thrombin from the blood and prevents it from converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K, inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase and prevents the regeneration of the functional hydroquinone form of the vitamin that is required for the γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in FII, FVII, FIX, and FX (see figures below).
