Concentration of myoepithelial cells Milk let-down Sucking at nipple ° Oxytocin (lactogenesis).

After parturition, the human breast produces colostrum, which is enriched with antimicrobial and antiinflammatory proteins. In the absence of placental progesterone, normal breast milk production occurs within a few days. The lobuloalveolar structures produce milk, which is subsequently modified by the ductal epithelium. Lactogenesis and maintenance of milk production (galactopoiesis) require stimulation by pituitary PRL in the presence of normal levels of other hormones, including insulin, cortisol, and thyroid hormone. Although placental estrogen stimulates PRL secretion during pregnancy, the stimulus for PRL secretion during the nursing period is suckling by the infant (

Fig. 44.38 ). Levels of PRL are directly correlated with frequency and duration of suckling at the nipple. The link between suckling at the nipple and PRL secretion involves a neuroendocrine reflex in which dopamine secretion at the median eminence is inhibited (the PRL release inhibitory factor; see ). It is also possible suckling increases secretion of unidentified PRL-releasing hormones.

PRL also inhibits release of GnRH, and consequently, nursing can be associated with lactational amenorrhea (see

Fig. 44.38 ). This effect of prolactin has been called “nature’s contraceptive,” and it may play a role in spacing out pregnancies. However, only regular nursing over a 24-hour period is sufficient to induce a PRL-induced anovulatory state in the mother. Thus lactational amenorrhea is not an effective or reliable form of birth control for most women. Inhibition of GnRH by high levels of PRL is important clinically. A prolactinoma is the most common form of hormone-secreting pituitary tumor, and hyperprolactinemia is a significant cause of infertility in both sexes. Hyperprolactinemia can likewise be associated with galactorrhea (inappropriate flow of breast milk) in men and women.

Suckling at the nipple also stimulates release of oxytocin from the pars nervosa (see

Fig. 44.38). Contraction of myoepithelial cells induces milk let-down, or expulsion of milk from the

alveolar and ductal lumens. Thus the nursing infant does not gain milk by applying negative pressure to the breast from suckling. Rather, milk is actively ejected through a neuroendocrine reflex. Oxytocin release and milk let-down can be induced by psychogenic stimuli such as the mother hearing a baby crying on television or thinking about her baby. Such psychogenic stimuli do not affect PRL release.

Though related to depletion of ovarian follicles, the causes and process of menopause are poorly understood. Age-related changes in the CNS, including critical patterns of GnRH secretion, precede follicular depletion and may play an important role in menopause. Because follicles do not develop in response to LH and FSH secretion, estrogen and progesterone levels drop. Loss of the negative-feedback inhibition of estrogen on GnRH and LH/FSH results in a marked rise in serum LH and FSH. FSH levels rise more than LH levels. This could result from loss of ovarian inhibin.

Menopause typically occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. It extends over a period of several years. Initially the cycles become irregular and are periodically anovulatory. The cycles tend to shorten, primarily in the follicular phase. Eventually the woman ceases to cycle altogether. Serum estradiol levels drop to about a sixth the mean levels for younger cycling women, and progesterone levels drop to about a third those in the follicular phase of younger women. Production of these hormones does not cease entirely, but the primary source of these hormones in postmenopausal women becomes the adrenal, although interstitial cells of the ovarian stroma continue to produce some steroids. Most circulating estrogens are now produced peripherally from androgens. Because estrone is the primary estrogen produced in adipose tissue, it becomes the predominant estrogen in postmenopausal women.

Most symptoms associated with menopause result from estrogen deficiency. The vaginal epithelium atrophies and becomes dry, and bone loss is accelerated and may lead to osteoporosis. The incidence of coronary artery disease increases markedly after menopause. Hot flashes result from periodic increases in core temperature, which produces peripheral vasodilation and sweating. Hot flashes are thought to be linked to increases in LH release and are probably associated not with the pulsatile rise in LH secretion but rather with central mechanisms controlling GnRH release. Hot flashes typically subside within 1 to 5 years of the onset of menopausal symptoms.

1.

The reproductive systems are composed of gonads, an internal reproductive tract with associated glands, and external genitalia. Mammary glands are accessory reproductive glands in women.

2.

Gonads have two main functions: production of gametes and production of hormones. Hormones (primarily sex steroids) are absolutely necessary for normal function of the reproductive system, and their production is regulated by a hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis.

3.

Seminiferous tubules in the testis contain Sertoli cells and developing sperm cells.

4.

Spermatogenesis refers to the progression of sperm cells from spermatogonia through the processes of meiosis and spermiogenesis to form mature spermatozoa.

5.

Testosterone and pituitary FSH are required for normal sperm production. Only Sertoli cells express the androgen receptor and the FSH receptor, so these hormones regulate spermatogenesis indirectly through their actions on Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which negatively feeds back on pituitary FSH production.

6.

Sertoli cells have many functions, including production of androgen-binding protein (ABP) and fluid and creation of the blood-testis barrier.

7.

Leydig cells are stromal cells that reside outside the seminiferous tubules. They respond to LH by producing testosterone.

8.

Testosterone is an active androgen. It can be converted peripherally to DHT, which is more active in certain tissues (e.g., prostate), or to estradiol.

9.

Leydig cells are regulated within a hypothalamicpituitary-testicular axis. The hypothalamus produces GnRH, which stimulates pituitary gonadotropes to secrete LH and FSH. Testosterone, DHT, and estradiol negatively feed back at the pituitary and hypothalamus and inhibit LH more than FSH secretion. Inhibin from the Sertoli cells selectively inhibits FSH.

10.

Testosterone, DHT, and estradiol have numerous actions on the male reproductive tract, external genitalia, and male secondary sex characteristics, as well as on other organ systems (e.g., blood cell production, lipoprotein production, bone maturation).

11.

The male tract includes tubal structures (epididymis, ductus deferens, and male urethra), accessory sex glands (seminal vesicles, prostate), and the penis. The seminal vesicles and the prostate produce most of the ejaculate, which nourishes, buffers, and protects sperm.

12.

Penile erection involves a complex neurovascular response leading to engorgement of the erectile tissue within the penis base and shaft with blood.

13.

The follicle is the functional unit of the ovary. Follicles contain epithelial cells (granulosa and cumulus) and outer stromal cells (thecal). All these cells surround a primary oocyte that remains arrested in the first meiotic prophase until just before ovulation.

14.

Follicles develop from the smallest (primordial) to a large antral follicle over a period of months. The latter part of follicular development requires gonadotropins.

15.

The menstrual cycle refers to an approximately 28-day cycle that is driven by the following ovarian events: development of one large antral follicle to a preovulatory follicle (follicular phase), ovulation, and formation and death of a corpus luteum of menstruation (luteal phase).

16.

The follicular phase of the ovary corresponds to the menstrual and proliferative phases of the uterine endometrium. The luteal phase of the ovary corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine endometrium.

17.

One dominant follicle is selected per menstrual cycle—usually the largest follicle with the most FSH receptors.

18.

High levels of estradiol occur around midcycle and exert positive feedback on gonadotropin secretion. This induces the LH (and a smaller FSH) surge. The midcycle gonadotropin surge induces (a) meiotic maturation of the primary oocyte so that it progresses to a secondary oocyte (with one polar body) arrested at metaphase of the second meiotic division, (b) breakdown of the ovarian and follicular wall so that the oocyte-cumulus complex is extruded (called ovulation), and (c) differentiation of the remaining follicular cells into a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces high levels of progesterone, estradiol, and inhibin.

19.

If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum will die in 14 days. This constitutes the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

20.

The oviducts capture the ovulated cumulus-oocyte complex and transport it medially into the oviduct and toward the uterus. Estrogen promotes ciliation and transport; progesterone inhibits transport.

21.

The uterine mucosa, called the endometrium, is the normal site of embryonic implantation. The mucosa is increased in thickness in preparation for implantation and is sloughed away if no pregnancy occurs.

22.

During the mid to late follicular phase (days 6–14 of the menstrual cycle), the ovary produces estradiol, which induces all cells of the endometrium to proliferate (called the proliferative phase of the uterus).

23.

After ovulation the ovary enters the luteal phase (days 16–28) and produces progesterone. Progesterone stimulates secretion from the uterine glands (called the secretory phase of the uterus).

24.

In the absence of an implanting embryo the corpus luteum dies, progesterone production ceases, and the uterine endometrium is sloughed (called the menstrual phase, or period, of the uterus—this corresponds to days 1 to 5 of the follicular phase of the ovary).

25.

The cervix is the lower portion of the uterus. Cervical mucus is hormonally regulated so that at midcycle in response to estrogen, cervical mucus promotes entry of sperm into the uterus from the vagina. During the luteal phase in response to progesterone, cervical mucus becomes thick and poses a barrier to entry of sperm and microbes into the uterus.

Fertilization is a complex series of events that occur in the oviduct and lead to penetration of the oocyte by sperm.

27.

Early embryogenesis (up to day 6 after fertilization) occurs in the oviduct and gives rise to a blastocyst that hatches from the zona pellucida.

28.

The placenta develops from the outer extraembryonic trophoblast. The endocrine function of the placenta includes production of hCG, progesterone, estrogens, and placental lactogen. Estrogen production requires placental cells (syncytiotrophoblasts) as well as the fetal adrenal and liver—collectively called the fetoplacental unit.

29.

Pregnancy and the hormones of pregnancy induce major changes in maternal physiology, including an increase in insulin resistance, an increase in the use of free fatty acids by the mother, and development of the mammary glands. Mammary gland development (but not lactation) is promoted by estrogen, progesterone, and placental lactogen but also by maternal pituitary prolactin, whose secretion is stimulated by placental estrogens.

 size (folate and B12 deficiencies) or decreased RBC size (iron and vitamin C deficiencies). In hemolytic anemias, such as is seen in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase deficiencies and in sickle cell anemia, RBC size typically is normal, and RBC number is decreased.

Case 4: Rapid Heart Rate, Headache, and Sweating with a Pheochromocytoma

Answer = D. Degradation of both epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE) involves methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) that produces normetanephrine from NE and metanephrine from epinephrine (see figure at right). Both of these products are deaminated to vanillylmandelic acid by monoamine oxidase (MAO). The substrate for the synthesis of the catecholamines is tyrosine, which gets hydroxylated to 3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tetrahydrobiopterin-requiring tyrosine hydroxylase. DOPA is converted to dopamine by a pyridoxal phosphate– requiring decarboxylase. [Note: Most carboxylases require biotin.] NE is converted to epinephrine by methylation, and S-adenosylmethionine provides the methyl group.

Answer = A. NE released from the sympathetic nervous system functions as a neurotransmitter that acts on postsynaptic neurons and causes, for example, increased heart rate. It is also released from the adrenal medulla and, along with epinephrine, functions as a counterregulatory hormone that results in mobilization of stored fuels (for example, glucose and triacylglycerols). These actions are mediated by the binding of NE to adrenergic receptors, which are G protein–coupled receptors of the plasma membrane, and not to nuclear receptors like those of steroid hormones or membrane tyrosine kinase receptors like that of insulin. Septic shock is vasodilatory hypotension (low blood pressure caused by blood vessel dilation) resulting from the production of large amounts of nitric oxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase in response to infection. NE bound to receptors on smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction and, thus, raises blood pressure.

Case 5: Sun Sensitivity with Xeroderma Pigmentosum

Answer = D. Pyrimidine dimers are the characteristic DNA lesions caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Their repair involves the excision of an oligonucleotide containing the dimer and replacement of that oligonucleotide, a process known as nucleotide excision repair (NER). (See figure at right for a representation of the process in prokaryotes.) DNA repair systems are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nothing is error free, but the homologous recombination (HR) method of double-strand break repair is much less prone to error than is the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) method because any DNA that was lost is replaced. Mismatched-base repair (MMR) involves identification and repair of the newly synthesized (daughter) strand. In prokaryotes, the extent of strand methylation is used to discriminate between the strands. Base excision repair (BER), the mechanism by which uracil is removed from DNA, utilizes a glycosylase to remove the base, creating an apyrimidinic or apurinic (AP) site. The sugar-phosphate is then removed by the actions of an endo-and exonuclease.

Answer = A. All replication requires an RNA primer because DNA polymerases (pol) cannot initiate DNA synthesis. The chromatin of eukaryotes gets decondensed (relaxed) for replication. Relaxation can be accomplished, for example, by acetylation via histone acetyltransferases. Prokaryotes have more than one DNA pol. For example, pol III extends the RNA primer with DNA, and pol I removes the primer and replaces it with DNA. Replication is initiated at specific locations (one in prokaryotes, many in eukaryotes) that are recognized by proteins (for example, DnaA in prokaryotes). Deoxynucleoside monophosphates (dNMP) are joined by a phosphodiester bond that links the 3′hydroxyl group of the last dNMP added with the 5′-phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide, thereby forming a 3′→5′-phosphodiester bond as pyrophosphate is released. Proofreading occurs during replication in the S (synthesis of DNA) phase of the cell cycle and involves the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity possessed by some DNA pol (see figure below). Because repair can occur independently of replication, it can be performed outside of the S phase.

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae with

Answer = B. Glutathione in its reduced form (G-SH) is an important antioxidant. The selenium-containing enzyme glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, a reactive oxygen species) to water as glutathionine is oxidized (G-S-S-G). Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)requiring glutathionine reductase regenerates G-SH from G-S-S-G (see Figure A). The NADPH is supplied by the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (see Figure B), which is regulated by the availability of NADPH at the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-catalyzed step (the first step). Deficiency of G6PD occurs in all cells, but the effects are seen in red blood cells where the pentose phosphate pathway is the only source of NADPH. The pathway involves two irreversible oxidative reactions, each of which generates NADPH. The NADPH is used in reductive processes such as fatty acid synthesis (not oxidation) as well as steroid hormone and cholesterol synthesis.

Answer = A. Jaundice (icterus) refers to the yellow color of the skin, nail beds, and sclerae that results from bilirubin deposition when the bilirubin level in the blood is elevated (hyperbilirubinemia; see Image C). Bilirubin has low solubility in aqueous solutions, and its solubility is increased by conjugation with uridine diphosphate–glucuronic acid in the liver, forming bilirubin diglucuronide or conjugated bilirubin (CB). In hemolytic conditions, such as G6PD deficiency, both CB and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) are increased, but it is UCB that is found in the blood. CB is sent into the intestine. Phototherapy is used to treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia because it converts bilirubin to isomeric forms that are more water soluble. Bilirubin is the product of heme degradation in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver and the spleen. The porphyrias are pathologies of heme synthesis and, therefore, are not characterized by hyperbilirubinemia.

With hemolysis, more bilirubin is produced and conjugated. CB is sent to the intestine where it is converted to urobilinogen, some of which is reabsorbed, enters the portal blood, and travels to the kidney. Because the source of urinary urobilinogen is intestinal urobilinogen, urinary urobilinogen will be low in obstructive jaundice because intestinal urobilinogen will be low as a result of the obstruction of the common bile duct (see Figure D).

Case 7: Joint Pain with Gout

Answer = F. Salvage of the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine to the purine nucleotides inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) requires 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) as the source of the ribose 1phosphate. Salvage decreases the amount of substrate available for degradation to uric acid. Therefore, a deficiency in salvage results in hyperuricemia (see figure at right). Noncompetitive inhibitors such as oxypurinol have no effect on the Michaelis constant (Km) but decrease the apparent maximal velocity (Vmax).

Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug. It has no effect on the enzymes of purine synthesis or degradation. Glutamine (not glutamate) is a nitrogen source for purine ring synthesis. In purine nucleotide synthesis, the purine ring system is constructed on the ribose 5-phosphate provided by PRPP. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase of purine degradation. The amidotransferase is the regulated enzyme of purine synthesis. Its activity is decreased by purine nucleotides and increased by PRPP.

Answer = B. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, decreasing the availability of N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate needed for synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) by thymidylate synthase (see figure at right). Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) II is the regulated enzymic activity of pyrimidine biosynthesis in humans. CPS I is an enzyme of the urea cycle. Orotic aciduria is a rare pathology of pyrimidine synthesis caused by a deficiency in one or both enzymic activities of bifunctional uridine monophosphate synthase. Pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, like purine synthesis and salvage, requires PRPP.

Increased activity of PRPP synthetase results in increased synthesis of PRPP. This results in an increase in purine nucleotide synthesis beyond need. The excess purine nucleotides get degraded to uric acid, thereby causing hyperuricemia.

Case 8: No Bowel Movement with Cystic Fibrosis

Answer = A. The clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) are the consequence of chloride retention with increased water absorption that causes mucus on an epithelial surface to be excessively thick and sticky. The result is pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems such as respiratory infection and impaired exocrine and endocrine pancreatic functions (pancreatic insufficiency). Impaired endocrine pancreatic function can result in diabetes with associated hyperglycemia. The genetic testing technique described, and one used in the diagnosis of CF, is the use of allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASO). Some mutations do result in increased degradation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, but degradation is initiated by tagging the protein with ubiquitin. Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame through the addition or deletion of nucleotides by a number not divisible by three. Because the ∆F509 mutation is caused by the loss of three nucleotides that code for phenylalanine (F) at position 509 in the CFTR protein, it is not a frameshift mutation. Answer = A. Targeting of proteins destined to function as components of the plasma membrane is an example of cotranslational targeting. It involves the initiation of translation on cytosolic ribosomes; recognition of the amino (N)terminal signal sequence in the protein by the signal recognition particle; movement of the protein-synthesizing complex to the outer face of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); and continuation of protein synthesis, such that the protein is threaded into the lumen of the ER and packaged into vesicles that travel to and through the Golgi and eventually fuse with the plasma membrane. The N-terminal signal sequence is removed by a peptidase in the lumen of the ER. Mannose 6-phosphate is the signal that cotranslationally targets proteins to the matrix of the lysosome where they function as acid hydrolases.

The pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with CF results in a decreased ability to digest food, and digestion is required for absorption. Dietary fats move through the intestine and are excreted in the stool (see figure at right), which is foul-smelling and bulky and may float. Patients are at risk for malnutrition and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins. Oral supplementation of pancreatic enzymes is the treatment.

Case 9: Hyperammonemia with a Urea Cycle Defect

Answer = B. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) cleaves argininosuccinate to arginine (Arg) and fumarate. The increase in argininosuccinate and citrulline and the decrease in Arg seen in RL indicate a deficiency in ASL (see figure below). With arginase deficiency, Arg would be increased, not decreased. Additionally, with arginase deficiency, the hyperammonemia would be less severe because two nitrogens are excreted. Deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) would also cause an increase in citrulline, but argininosuccinate would be low to absent. Deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) I is characterized by low levels of Arg and citrulline. Deficiency of ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), the only X-linked enzyme of the urea cycle, would result in low levels of Arg and citrulline and elevated levels of urinary orotic acid. [Note: The orotic acid is elevated because the carbamoyl phosphate (CP) substrate of OTC is being used in the cytosol as a substrate for pyrimidine synthesis.]

Arg supplementation is helpful because the Arg will be hydrolyzed to urea + ornithine by arginase. The ornithine will be combined with CP to form citrulline (see figure above). With ASL (and ASS) deficiency, citrulline accumulates and is excreted, thereby carrying waste nitrogen out of the body. Answer = D. In individuals with milder (partial) deficiencies in the enzymes of the urea cycle, hyperammonemia may be triggered by physiologic stress (for example, an illness or prolonged fasting) that decreases the insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio. [Note: The degree of the hyperammonemia is usually less severe than that seen in the neonatal onset forms.] The shift in the ratio results, in part, in skeletal muscle proteolysis, and the amino acids that are released get degraded. Degradation involves transamination by pyridoxal phosphate–requiring aminotransferases that generate the α-keto acid derivative of the amino acid + glutamate. The glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia (NH3) by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; see figure at right). [Note: GDH is unusual in that it uses both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as coenzymes.]

The NH3, which is toxic, can be transported to the liver as glutamine (Gln) and alanine (Ala). The Gln is generated by the amination of glutamate by ATP-requiring glutamine synthetase. In the liver, the enzyme glutaminase removes the NH3, which can be converted to urea by the urea cycle or excreted as ammonium (NH4+) (see figure at right). Gln, then, is a nontoxic vehicle of NH3 transport in the blood. Ala is generated in skeletal muscle from the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). In the liver, Ala is transaminated by alanine transaminase (ALT) to pyruvate (used in gluconeogenesis) and glutamate. Thus, Ala carries nitrogen to the liver for conversion to urea (see figure below). Therefore, defects in the urea cycle would result in an elevation in NH3, Gln, and Ala. The elevated NH3 drives respiration, and the hyperventilation causes a rise in pH (respiratory alkalosis). [Note: Hyperammonemia is toxic to the nervous system. Although the exact mechanisms are not completely understood, it is known that the metabolism of large amounts of NH3 to Gln (in the astrocytes of the brain) results in osmotic effects that cause the brain to swell. Additionally, the rise in Gln decreases the availability of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter.]

Case 10: Swollen, Painful Calf with Deep Venous Thrombosis

Answer = D. Thrombin, a serine protease, is activated by the prothrombinase complex of factor (F)Xa + FVa. Once formed, activated thrombin (FIIa) proteolytically activates components of the extrinsic (FVII) and intrinsic (FXI, FVIII) pathways, generating FXa. Thrombin can also activate FV, FI, and FXIII of the common pathway (see figure below). Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in FVIII. FIX deficiency results in hemophilia B. FIII, also known as tissue factor (TF), is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the vascular endothelium. It functions as an accessory protein and not a protease. Formation of the platelet plug is primary hemostasis, and formation of the fibrin meshwork is secondary hemostasis. Vitamin K is required for the activation (γ-carboxylation) of FII, FVII, FIX, and FX (proteases that require calcium [Ca2+] and phospholipids [PL]) but not for FI (fibrinogen).

Answer = C. FV Leiden is a mutant form of FV that is resistant to proteolysis by the activated protein C complex. Decreased ability to degrade FV allows continued production of activated thrombin and leads to an increased risk of clot formation or thrombophilia. Antithrombin III (ATIII) and protein S are proteins of anticoagulation. Increased, not decreased, production of prothrombin would result in thrombophilia. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor causes a coagulopathy or a deficiency in clotting through effects on FVIII and platelets. Heparin and warfarin are anticoagulants. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, increases the affinity of ATIII for thrombin. Binding of ATIII removes thrombin from the blood and prevents it from converting fibrinogen to fibrin. Warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K, inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase and prevents the regeneration of the functional hydroquinone form of the vitamin that is required for the γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues to γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in FII, FVII, FIX, and FX (see figures below).

Unlike ordinary nevi, dysplastic nevi have a tendency to occur on body surfaces not exposed to the sun as well as on sun-exposed sites. Familial dysplastic nevus syndrome is strongly associated with melanoma, as the lifetime risk for the development of melanoma in affected individuals is close to 100%. In sporadic cases, only individuals with 10 or more dysplastic nevi appear to be at an increased risk for melanoma. Transformation of dysplastic nevus to melanoma has been documented, both clinically and histologically. However, such cases are the exception, as most melanomas appear to arise de novo and not from a preexisting nevus. Thus, the likelihood that any particular nevus, dysplastic or otherwise, will develop into melanoma is low, and these lesions are best viewed as markers of melanoma risk.

Melanoma is less common but much more deadly than basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Today, as a result of increased public awareness of the earliest signs of skin melanomas, most melanomas are cured surgically. Nonetheless, the incidence of these lesions has increased dramatically over the past several decades, at least in part as a result of increasing sun exposure and/or higher detection rates resulting from vigorous surveillance.

As with other cutaneous malignancies, melanoma is mainly caused by UV light–induced DNA damage that leads to the stepwise acquisition of driver mutations. The incidence is highest in sun-exposed skin and in geographic locales such as Australia, where sun exposure is high and much of the population is fair-skinned. Intense intermittent exposure at an early age is particularly harmful. Hereditary predisposition also plays a role in an estimated 5% to 10% of cases, as already discussed under familial dysplastic nevus syndrome. For example, germ-line mutations in the CDKN2A locus (located on 9p21) are found in as many as 40% of the rare individuals who suffer from familial melanoma. This complex locus encodes two tumor suppressors: p16, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that regulates the G1-S transition of the cell cycle by maintaining the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein in its active state; and p14, which augments the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor by preventing its degradation.

Key phases of melanoma development are marked by radial and vertical growth. The earliest recognizable phase of melanoma development is proposed to consist of lateral expansion of melanocytes along the dermoepidermal junction (lentiginous hyperplasia and lentiginous compound nevus;

Fig. 24.21A-C ). This then progresses to the phase of melanoma in situ, which is marked by radial growth within the epidermis, often for a prolonged period (

Fig.

24.21D ). During this stage, melanoma cells do not have the capacity to invade and metastasize. With time, a vertical growth phase supervenes, in which the tumor grows downward into the deeper dermal layers as an expansile mass lacking cellular maturation (

Fig. 24.21E ). This event often is heralded by the development of a nodule in a previously flat lesion and correlates with the emergence of metastatic  potential.

DNA sequencing of familial and sporadic cases, including cases that appear to have arisen from benign nevi, has provided important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma (

Fig. 24.22 ). The initiating event appears to be an activating mutation in BRAF or (less commonly) RAS. In the vast majority of cases, this produces only a benign nevus unless other mutations are superimposed. Sequencing of nevi with “atypical” morphologic features suggestive of melanoma as well as melanomas in the radial phase of growth (melanoma in situ) has shown that they commonly harbor mutations that activate the expression of telomerase, which is proposed to serve as an antidote to senescence (the usual fate of benign nevi). With additional mutations or epigenetic aberrations that lead to loss of

CDNK2A and its encoded tumor suppressor p16, the tumor shifts to the invasive vertical phase of growth. Throughout this cutaneous phase of tumor evolution, exposure to UV light adds to the mutational burden and increases the chances of tumor progression. Finally, with additional mutations in genes such as tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN, the tumor acquires the capacity for metastasis. This phase is marked by the appearance of aneuploidy and genomic copy number alterations, which add to the genetic heterogeneity of the evolving tumor.

By contrast, the less common melanomas that arise in non–sun-exposed acral and mucosal sites follow different molecular courses. The most common initiating mutation in these tumors is a gain-of-function mutation in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase. Similarly, melanomas arising the uvea of the eye also have a distinct set of driver gene mutations, most notably mutually exclusive mutations that activate the GTP-binding proteins GNAQ or GNA11.

In addition, it has long been speculated that melanomas express neoantigens that should be subject to recognition by the immune system. It follows that for melanoma to develop, tumor cells must acquire the ability to either suppress or evade the host immune response. The importance of immune evasion has been proven by the response of many advanced melanomas to immune checkpoint inhibitors, agents that unleash muzzled melanoma-specific T cells, allowing them to attack the tumor (described later).

Although most of these lesions arise in the skin, they also may occur in the oral and anogenital mucosal surfaces, the esophagus, the meninges, and the eye. The following discussion applies to cutaneous melanomas.

Melanoma of the skin usually is asymptomatic, although pruritus may be an early manifestation. The most important clinical sign is a change in the color or size of a pigmented lesion. The main clinical warning signs are as follows: 1.

Rapid enlargement of a preexisting nevus 2.

3.

Development of a new pigmented lesion during adult life 4.

Irregularity of the borders of a pigmented lesion 5.

Variegation of color within a pigmented lesion

These principles are expressed in the so-called “ABCs” of melanoma: asymmetry, border, color, diameter, and evolution (change of an existing nevus). It is vitally important to recognize melanomas and intervene as rapidly as possible. The vast majority of superficial lesions are curable surgically, while metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis.

The probability of metastasis is predicted by measuring the depth of invasion in millimeters of the vertical growth phase nodule from the top of the granular cell layer of the overlying epidermis (Breslow thickness). Metastasis risk also is increased in tumors with a high mitotic rate and in those that fail to induce a local immune response. When metastases occur, they involve not only regional lymph nodes but also liver, lungs, brain, and virtually any other site that can be seeded hematogenously. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (of the first draining node[s] of a primary melanoma) at the time of surgery provides additional information on biologic aggressiveness.

Agents that selectively inhibit mutant BRAF and KIT have produced dramatic responses in patients with metastatic tumors with BRAF and KIT mutations, respectively, an encouraging development in a previously hopeless disease. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective at stabilizing metastatic disease and in some instances causing remarkable tumor regression and even clinical remissions. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are antibodies that interfere with the function of proteins found on the surface of T lymphocytes that abrogate cytotoxic T cell responsiveness. By blocking these pathways, checkpoint inhibitors reactivate the host T-cell response, which otherwise is held at bay. Current efforts are focused on building upon these successes by using combinations of different checkpoint inhibitors, as well as checkpoint inhibitors together with other targeted therapies such as BRAF inhibitors.

They are examples of crowdsourcing whereby information is gathered by enlisting the assistance of a large number of participants. Crowdsourcing often involves the general public or a loosely defined group of individuals as opposed to outsourcing, which tasks a project to a specific company or group. For example, Wikipedia is an example of crowdsourcing. In surgery, an example of crowdsourcing are the web-based communities formed by the American College of Surgeons. Members can belong to one or more communities which are based on specialty (i.e., general surgery or endocrine surgery), geography (i.e., Florida Chapter), level of education (i.e., medical students or senior surgeons), special interest (i.e., surgeon writers), or issue (i.e., quality improvement and advo-cacy). Members can post and respond to discussion threads that cover a wide range of topics including advice for challenging cases, surgical history, and political issues.An example of a social media–based interactive forum is the International Hernia Collaboration (IHC) which is housed on Facebook. Participants include not only surgeons but also healthcare providers and industry representatives interested in improving outcomes after hernia surgery. Membership in the IHC is limited to those who have been vetted and approved. The forum allows members to ask for advice on difficult cases, debate controversial topics, post step-by-step instructions on procedures or management strategies, and disseminate informa-tion rapidly to a wide audience. Collaborative forums such as the IHC allow for real-time, interactive, case-based, continuing education.Public EducationThe educational opportunities provided by the internet and social media are not limited to healthcare providers. The inter-net and social media are also being increasingly used to educate patients and their families. There are multiple media through which health education is spread, including, but not limited to, online or social media discussion forums run by patients, patient support groups, healthcare providers, or healthcare orga-nizations; blogs or newsrooms; or electronic and mobile health patient portals. Social media allows patients rapid access to information regardless of time or location. However, as noted in the following section, the accuracy of social media–based educational materials cannot be guaranteed, and patients should utilize caution in relying on the information to make important healthcare decisions.PITFALLS IN WEB AND SOCIAL MEDIA–BASED EDUCATIONDespite the many advantages of web and social media–based education, significant potential pitfalls still remain. First, widespread adoption and utilization is a challenge. Although internet and mobile phone usage is prevalent, effec-tiveness of web-based educational materials is dependent upon trainees’ and surgeons’ uptake of the technology and available resources. Despite increasing availability of the internet and mobile technology, not all surgeons use it for educational pur-poses. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Guraya et al found that three out of four medical students use social networking sites, but only one out of five uses them for educational purposes. Furthermore, lack of utilization can impact educational effectiveness. In the previously mentioned multicenter trial comparing a moderated journal club to an online version, low participation in the Internet journal club was postulated to be a significant factor in the poorer perfor-mance on a critical appraisal test. More attention to instruc-tional design may improve uptake and effectiveness. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Cook et al determined that features such as interactivity, practice exercises, repeti-tion, and feedback are associated with improved learning out-comes. The authors also noted that the evidence base upon which to design internet-based learning programs is limited by poor study methodology, failure to use conceptual frame-works, and lack of adherence to reporting standards. Thus, while the aforementioned features should be considered in designing future web and social media–based educational pro-grams, further evidence-based guidance is needed.Second, the quality of information available online and via social media may not be accurate or reliable. Multiple reports have been published regarding the inaccuracies of web-based educational materials. Surgeons and surgical trainees should carefully evaluate the source of educational material, search for conflicts of interest that may result in biased information, assess how recently the information was updated, and cross-check references. The lay public may have more difficulty in identifying trustworthy surgical educational materials on the internet. Healthcare providers should guide patients to reputable websites and to encourage discussion regarding the accuracy of the content.Third, useful dialog and advice about difficult cases must be balanced with ethical considerations surrounding patient con-fidentiality and privacy. Appropriate safeguards must be taken 7Brunicardi_Ch54_p2187-p2196.indd   219213/02/19   2:37 PM 2193WEB-BASED EDUCATION AND IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIACHAPTER 54Table 54-2The American College of Physicians Ethics, Professionalism and Human Rights Committee; the American College of Physicians Council of Associates; and the Federation of State Medical Boards Special Committee on Ethics and Professionalism published a position paper on online medical professionalismPosition 1Use of online media can bring significant educational benefits to patients and physicians, but it may also pose ethical challenges. Maintaining trust in the profession and in patient–physician relationships requires that physicians consistently apply ethical principles for preserving the relationship, confidentiality, privacy, and respect for persons to online settings and communications.Position 2The boundaries between professional and social spheres can blur online. Physicians should keep the two spheres separate and comport themselves professionally in both.Position 3Email or other electronic communications should only be used by physicians in an established patient–physician relationship and with patient consent. Documentation about patient care communications should be included in the patient’s medical record.Position 4Physicians should consider periodically “self-auditing” to assess the accuracy of information available about them on physician-ranking websites and other sources online.Position 5The reach of the internet and online communications is far and often permanent. Physicians, trainees, and medical students should be aware that online postings may have future implications for their professional lives.Data from Farnan JM1, Snyder Sulmasy L, Worster BK, et al: Online medical professionalism: patient and public relationships: policy statement from the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards, Ann Intern Med. 2013 Apr 16;158(8):620-627.to ensure that patients cannot be identified based on provided information, that patients have consented to have their informa-tion posted anonymously, and that all case-related comments are appropriate and professional. While common sense should be utilized in posting about patient cases, only a few organizations have published guidelines for how to safeguard against potential pitfalls. In 2013, the American College of Physicians Ethics, Professionalism, and Human Rights Committee; the American College of Physicians Council of Associates; and the Federa-tion of State Medical Boards Special Committee on Ethics and  Professionalism published a position statement about online medical education (Table 54-2). The paper stated that “Maintain-ing trust in the profession and in patient–physician relationships requires that physicians consistently apply ethical principles for preserving the relationship, confidentiality, privacy, and respect for persons to online settings and communications.”Fourth, conflicts of interest must be clearly stated. Jour-nals require authors to declare relevant conflicts of interest, but multiple studies suggest that these often go unreported. Simi-larly, conflicts of interest should be disclosed on social media. However, such disclosures may be more difficult on social media due to the limited number of allowable characters (i.e., 140 characters for Twitter) or to the way information is propa-gated. For example, a surgeon may disclose an industry relation-ship on an original tweet, but the disclosure may not appear in subsequent comments of a discussion thread. Surgeons post-ing on social media must make it their ethical and professional obligation to disclose their conflicts of interest. Furthermore, users of social media content must be aware of the potential for bias introduced by undisclosed conflicts of interest and per-form due diligence in assessing the reliability of the source. Lastly, regulatory bodies and professional organizations should publish standardized guidelines for disclosing on social media or develop mechanisms by which disclosure can be publicly accessed (such as the Open Payments database).Fifth, professionalism must always be maintained. Sur-geons posting content on the web or on social media must be aware that information will be widely disseminated and avail-able for posterity; messages posted on social media cannot be fully retracted. As already mentioned, surgeons must strive to maintain patient privacy, ensure accuracy of information, and disclose conflicts of interest. Furthermore, surgeons must be aware of unintentional interpretations of messages (i.e., as discriminatory or unprofessional). Multiple studies of health-care providers’ social media sites have identified potentially and clearly unprofessional content; these studies have included medical students, residents, and practicing surgeons. Despite the prevalence of unprofessional content, few surgical residency programs have formal institutional social media policies. Fur-thermore, the American College of Physicians and Federation of State Medical Boards position statement only addresses a few of the issues surrounding web-based activities including for patient and physician education (Table 54-3).Table 54-3Online medical professionalism and educationPOSITIONS ON PROFESSIONALISM IN ONLINE PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN EDUCATION•	The Internet can be a powerful tool for education.•	Physicians should guide patients to high quality online resources that are accurate and objective. These sites should have peer-reviewed content or have verifiable mechanisms for quality control of information.•	Online resources for learning can be used by patients and physicians.•	The internet and social networking can be used to improve public health. Physicians engaged in online communities should ensure the security of the networks and restriction of participation to verified users. Clinical scenarios should not contain any personal identifying information, and patient consent should be obtained before sharing the vignette.•	Discussion of frustrations online undermines trust and professionalism and should be avoided.Data from Farnan JM1, Snyder Sulmasy L, Worster BK, et al: Online medical professionalism: patient and public relationships: policy statement from the American College of Physicians and the Federation of State Medical Boards, Ann Intern Med. 2013 Apr 16;158(8):620-627.Brunicardi_Ch54_p2187-p2196.indd   219313/02/19   2:37 PM 2194SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IILastly, studies evaluating the effectiveness of web-based education have had varied results. A recent systematic review by Taveira-Gomes et al assessed 251 articles using computer-based learning methodologies in medical education; the num-ber of articles on this topic has increased over time. The most commonly used metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of these methodologies were assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The majority of studies reported positive effects on these outcomes, although the more rigorous studies (i.e., randomized trials) were less likely to find a positive effect. Online activ-ity (i.e., number of posts or views) was tracked in a few stud-ies, but results were conflicting regarding whether increased engagement correlated with improved performance. This review suggests that high-quality studies are needed of web-based edu-cational interventions and that these studies need to include measures of clinical performance and outcomes.IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSThe Society of University Surgeons’ Social and Legislative Committee issued a position statement entitled: “Social media is a necessary component of surgery practice.” Given the rapid pace with which technology is advancing and the familiar-ity of the current generation (Generation Z) with the inter-net, surgeons have no choice but to harness the power of the internet and social media or risk being left behind. Many jour-nals are phasing out print versions, and several journals are already online only. Furthermore, textbooks may also become a relic from the past as publishers move towards developing digi-tal versions that include interactive graphics, audio, and video.As surgical education continues to evolve, future directions may include broader indications for utilization of weband social media-based resources. For example, video-based coaching with face-to-face discussions have been used postoperatively to sup-plement intraoperative teaching. However, preoperative crowd-sourcing in planning a challenging case or intraoperative video telementoring are other applications of video-based coaching.Future research efforts should focus on identifying the most effective formats and components of web and social media–based educational interventions, using rigorous methods to compare educational methods, and measuring clinical out-comes. Moreover, standardized guidelines should be instituted in order to safeguard against ethical and professional misconduct.BIBLIOGRAPHYBirkmeyer JD, Finks JF, O’Reilly A, Oerline M, et al; Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative.

 stages of the testing process, from specimen collection to result interpretation. An error arising at any stage may adversely affect patient care. In clinical laboratory practice, it is customary to divide the testing process into three phases: preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic. Examples of each type of error are shown in Table 480e-3. The most common error in the testing process is specimen mislabeling, in which a specimen from one patient is placed in a container labeled with another patient’s name or identifiers. Specimen mislabeling errors may have very serious consequences for a patient. For example, if erroneous typing of a patient’s blood group results from specimen mislabeling and is followed by transfusion of a mismatched unit of blood, the outcome may be fatal. A mislabeled biopsy specimen can lead either to an erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate therapy or to a failure to make a diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy.

In addition to errors, many preanalytic factors can influence clinical laboratory results. Posture (i.e., recumbent versus upright), exercise, diet, recently ingested food, and use of prescribed or recreational drugs (including tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and herbal supplements) can influence a variety of analyte concentrations. After blood has been collected, certain analytes undergo changes in their concentration during storage or transportation. Glucose levels fall as a result of red cell metabolism. Ammonia levels rise as a result of protein breakdown. Increasing permeability and breakdown of red cell membranes leads to increases in plasma potassium and free hemoglobin levels. Bacterial contamination can lead to overgrowth of specimens. To minimize tabLe 480e-3 exaMpLeS of preaNaLytiC, aNaLytiC, aNd poStaNaLytiC errorS duriNg the Laboratory teStiNg proCeSS

The list of known preanalytic variables and their effects is extensive, and the reader is referred to the compendium on this subject (see Young DS: Effects of Preanalytical Variables on Clinical Laboratory Tests, 3rd ed. Washington, DC, AACC Press, 2007).

The great majority of tests continue to be performed in dedicated clinical laboratory facilities, but for several decades there has been a trend toward point-of-care testing. This change has been made possible by the development of portable analytic devices, including single-purpose instruments such as glucometers and oxygen saturation monitors, and multifunction instruments that can perform a wider variety of analyses, particularly in chemistry and hematology but also in some areas of microbiology. The use of these devices is driven largely by the convenience of faster result availability. In some settings (e.g., in rural areas and developing countries), there may be no easily accessible clinical laboratory and a point-of-care device may be the best or only option for testing. However, the per-specimen cost of point-of-care testing, in terms both of reagents and supplies and of personnel, is often greater than that of centralized testing. Other concerns relate to the adequacy of personnel training for point-of-care testing, the quality of the results, and the incorporation of results into the medical record.

One of the largest markets for point-of-care testing is home testing by patients, which has long been an important element in the management of persons with diabetes who monitor their own blood glucose levels. Over-the-counter kits for home pregnancy testing have been available for decades. More recently, kits have become available for home testing of the international normalized ratio or prothrombin time by patients taking oral anticoagulants. Kits are also available for cholesterol monitoring, fecal occult-blood detection, and hemoglobin measurement. In these areas, there is often little information on the quality of test performance, the accuracy of the results, or the correctness of result interpretation.

The principles of genetic medicine in clinical practice are dis cussed in Chaps. 82–84. Here we will concentrate on issues related to clinical laboratory testing for genetic disease.

The distinction between genetic testing for inherited disorders and that for acquired disorders affects the type of tissue that should be obtained for analysis. In inherited disorders, all nucleated cells are expected to carry the inherited mutation; thus white blood cells or buccal cells (obtained by scraping the inside of the cheek) are convenient sources of DNA for clinical laboratory testing. For prenatal testing of the fetus, chorionic villi or amniocytes are commonly used. In tests for acquired genetic disorders (e.g., in tumors), the tissue of interest that contains a suspected mutation must be sampled. It is often useful to compare tumor DNA with the patient’s normal DNA in order to identify acquired mutations (e.g., testing for microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer; Chap. 101e).

Although it is assumed that all clinical laboratory testing is performed with the consent of the patient (or, in the case of minors, the parents), regulations may require formal written consent for genetic testing. Such regulations vary among jurisdictions, and the practicing clinician should be aware of local regulations. In some jurisdictions, there are regulations on the storage and use of genetic information and on the maximal period for which genetic specimens may be stored.

For some late-onset genetic diseases, such as Huntington’s disease (Chap. 449), genetic testing allows a prediction about the future development of the disease. The degree of certainty that is possible on the basis of this testing surpasses that associated with identifica-480e-5 tion of more traditional disease risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia as a risk factor for future myocardial infarction). When deciding to undertake predictive genetic testing, it is important for the patient to consider the broad implications of a positive or negative test result, to be made aware of any support and counseling that is available, and to understand the implications of a result for other family members. In dealing with these issues, genetic counselors play an important role (Chap. 84). Their expertise includes the ability to explain genetic disorders at an understandable level to patients and their families, to arrange for support services, and to provide genetic risk assessments to members of families with genetic disorders.

When testing for genetic disorders, the clinical laboratory will use different analytic approaches according to the disease of interest. Some disorders, such as sickle cell anemia, are caused by single-point mutations. Testing for these disorders involves mere assessment for one or a few mutations in a single gene. Other disorders (e.g., hyperphenylalaninemias) may be caused by numerous mutations in a single gene. Still others (e.g., hereditary breast cancer) may be caused by mutations in many genes. The number of possible mutations and genes that underlie a clinical phenotype affects the cost of and time required for clinical laboratory testing as well as the likelihood of finding a disease-causing mutation.

If a disease phenotype can be caused by many mutations, a clinical laboratory result that is negative should be interpreted with care. For example, it is common to screen healthy pregnant women (and their partners) for mutations in the CFTR gene, which is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this screening is to identify women who are carriers of a CFTR mutation and therefore are at increased risk of having a baby with CF. Because CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, a fetus has a 1:4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers of disease-causing CFTR mutations. The screening test approach that is commonly used to identify mutations in carriers detects 80–85% of all known disease-causing CFTR mutations in Caucasians and up to 97% of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews. A negative screening result therefore does not completely eliminate the possibility that a woman (or her partner) actually has a mutation. What can be inferred from a negative test result is that the risk of having a CF-affected baby has decreased significantly to an extent that depends on the woman’s ethnic group and the mutations that were examined. The clinical laboratory should calculate and report the woman’s new risk of being a carrier if the screening result is negative.

The increasing availability of large-scale (next-generation) sequencing of a patient’s whole genome or exome will greatly affect genetic testing over the next decade, with implications for the number of mutations that can be detected and the increased complexity of result interpretation.

Genetic testing has limitations that are often unique to this field. Results may be inconclusive. For example, a search for mutations in a gene that is suspected of causing a disease may fail to reveal any known disease-causing mutations. A mutation may be discovered that is of unknown clinical significance. In this situation, consideration of the predicted change in the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein may suggest a biologic effect—e.g., replacement of a charged amino acid by one of the opposite charge or by a neutral amino acid; replacement of an amino acid by one of a different size; or replacement of an amino acid that is conserved across multiple species. Further information may be obtained by determining whether the mutation is found in healthy individuals. Even with all of these considerations, it is not uncommon that the biologic significance of an identified mutation remains uncertain, and further research may be needed to assess its significance.

It is also important to understand the limitations of the clinical laboratory approach used to detect mutations. At this time, next-generation sequencing remains an impractical undertaking for financial reasons, although extensive sequence analysis has become the

Chapter 480e The Clinical Laboratory in Modern Health Care standard of care for a few genes (e.g., analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in assessing the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in individuals with a strong family history of these disorders). As sequencing technologies become less expensive, they can be expected to be more commonly used for both identifying mutations in patients with genetic disorders and screening asymptomatic individuals at risk of genetic disease.

Another unique aspect of genetic testing is the concern that genetic information about individuals may be used to discriminate against them by employers or by insurance companies. In the United States, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits the use of genetic information by employers in making decisions related to employment and by health insurance companies in issuing insurance policies or setting premium rates based on knowledge of the applicant’s genetic status. GINA does not cover disability insurance, long-term care insurance, or life insurance policies.

Although public attention has been most closely focused on DNA testing, other clinical laboratory investigations that are not usually thought of as genetic may provide important genetic information about the person being tested. For example, serum protein electrophoresis may reveal α-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Depending on the clinical laboratory technology used, measurement of hemoglobin A1C, commonly used for monitoring diabetes control, may reveal a hemoglobin variant such as HbS (sickle cell). Measurement of cholesterol and triglyceride levels may reveal any of a number of hereditary disorders. All of these results are types of genetic information.

In the United States, all clinical laboratory testing performed for clinical purposes (but not for research purposes) is regulated by the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Act of 1988 (CLIA). Home monitoring by patients who are testing their own specimens is not covered by CLIA. The statute and the regulations, which are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, apply to all laboratories, whether located in a physician’s office, a large hospital, or a reference laboratory; and all laboratories are required to hold a valid CLIA certificate that is appropriate for the highest complexity level of the tests they perform. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for assigning the complexity level of commercial tests. The lowest category of complexity is the “waived” category, which is followed (in order of increasing complexity) by the categories of “provider-performed microscopy,” “moderatecomplexity testing,” and “high-complexity testing.” The category of provider-performed microscopy is used to cover tests such as the use of potassium hydroxide preparations on skin scrapings to examine for fungi, fern tests, and sperm motility tests; it does not encompass histopathology that falls into the high-complexity category. Even if a clinical laboratory is performing only testing in the “waived” category, it must still hold a valid CLIA certificate. Laboratories that hold certificates for nonwaived tests are required to participate in proficiency testing and are regularly inspected to monitor their performance.

oses have far-reaching medical significance, for they provide artificial models and a neurologic perspective of psychoses created by the manipulation of metabolic and by exogenous factors. It is appropriate that they are in the last chapter in a book about neurology.

First described in arthritic patients being treated with cortisone, these syndromes are now occurring far less frequently than when corticosteroids were introduced into medical practice. The psychosis usually develops over a period of a few days after the patient has received the hormone for a week or more. The features are extremely variable. Depression and insomnia are the most frequent early symptoms, but some patients become elated, agitated, excited, and talkative, as though under pressure to speak, whereas others are mute; or the prevailing emotional response may be one of anxiety and panic. Thinking may be slightly illogical, tangential, or incoherent. Hallucinations and sensory misinterpretations may appear. However, clouding of the sensorium and disorientation, the hallmarks of deliria and the confusional psychoses, have been less prominent. Nevertheless, the state of awareness is not altogether normal, and at times the patient is frankly bewildered. If administration of the hormone is discontinued as soon as symptoms appear, the psychosis subsides but only gradually over several days to weeks, with complete recovery.

In patients with Cushing disease, mental changes are frequent. In some patients there is a combination of affective disorder and impairment of cognitive function, usually apparent during mental status testing. Also, among athletes taking anabolic steroids, some develop affective and psychotic symptoms—reduced sleep, irritability, aggression, paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, and euphoria or depression. Mental changes in Addison disease are frequent but varied. Irritability, confusion, disorientation, and convulsions, with or without symptoms of hypoglycemia, are the main features.

The mechanisms are not well understood. The mechanism of acute steroid psychosis is obscure. From the few available studies it has been learned that the occurrence of the psychosis is not related to the premorbid personality. Although the dosage of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticosteroid has usually been high, there has been no definite correlation between the dosage and the occurrence, severity, and duration of psychosis. In a study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus by Chau and Chi, 5 percent of patients became psychotic with steroid treatment, and for an obscure reason, only hypoalbuminemia was found by statistical analysis to be an associated factor. A history of anxiety or of a family history of psychiatric disease had only a marginal predictive value for steroid-induced psychosis. The notion held by many neurologists that dexamethasone is less frequently associated with psychosis than other corticosteroids is unproven. Lithium is often effective in controlling manic symptoms, allowing continuation of the corticosteroid therapy if necessary for the underlying medical condition. The dose is the same as for manic states (see Falk et al).

A great deal has been said about the pervasive effects of abnormal thyroid function on all organs, including the neuromuscular apparatus and central nervous system. These are discussed in Chap. 39 with other acquired metabolic diseases of the nervous system, but mental changes with these endocrinopathies are not nearly as frequent or prominent as for adrenal disorders.

The hyperthyroid patient shows minor changes in emotions and mentation. Restlessness, irritability, apprehension, emotional lability, and at times even agitation and a generalized chorea may occur. Either of 2 trends may be observed in the relatively rare thyrotoxic patient who develops a psychosis. There may be a mild manic state, with its characteristic increase in psychomotor activity, excessive talkativeness, and flight of ideas, or there may be depression, with its somber mood, weeping, and anxiety. Visual and auditory hallucinations may be present in both groups. Usually there is something more than simple mania or agitated depression, that is, some clouding of the sensorium with perplexity and confusion, suggestive of delirium. The condition is said to be related to the premorbid personality, some personality types being more vulnerable, but this is disputed. It can be stated that the psychiatric changes are not directly related to the severity of the thyrotoxicosis. Treatment of the hyperthyroidism does not result in prompt arrest of the psychic disorder; recovery usually takes place over a period of months. One must distinguish this illness from other types of recurrent psychoses that happen to be coincidental with or precipitated by hyperthyroidism and from the steroid-responsive encephalopathy called “Hashimoto encephalopathy” mentioned below.

With myxedema there is a characteristic slowness and thickness of speech, drowsiness, hypothermia, mental dullness, listlessness and apathy, irritability, and sometimes suspiciousness. The patient may sleep most of the time, having to be awakened for meals. A disturbance of memory and the lack of genuine symptoms of depression, such as feelings of hopelessness and loss of self-esteem, help to distinguish the mental disorder of myxedema from that of a depressive illness. Nevertheless, unless one thinks of myxedema in cases of psychomotor retardation, the diagnosis will be missed. Reduced cerebral blood flow and metabolism have been found in myxedema; with specific therapy, these functions are restored to normal within 2 to 3 weeks.

An entirely different type of mental disturbance characterized by intermittent delirium and stupor often associated with myoclonus and autoimmune in nature may occur in patients with thyroiditis (“Hashimoto encephalopathy,” Chap. 39). The illness is responsive to glucocorticoids. The diagnosis is confirmed by the finding of circulating antibodies to thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase but there are high rates of false positive tests, particularly in middle-aged an older women.

Commercial preparation courses can be helpful for some students, but such courses are typically expensive and require significant time commitment. They are usually effective in organizing study material for students who feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material involved in Step 2 CK preparation. Note that multiweek courses may be quite intense and may thus leave limited time for independent study. Also note that some commercial courses are designed for first-time test takers while others focus on students who are repeating the exam. In addition, some courses are geared toward IMGs who want to take all three Steps in a limited amount of time.

Student experience and satisfaction with review courses are highly variable. We suggest that you discuss options with recent graduates of the review courses you are considering. In addition, course content and structure can change rapidly. Some student opinions can be found in discussion groups on the World Wide Web. Listed below is contact information for some Step 2 CK commercial review courses.

, and saccule. Like the cochlear apparatus, each of these vestibular organs is located within a membranous (ductal) portion of the vestibular apparatus, which is surrounded by a bony (canal) portion (eFig. 9.83). The cell bodies for these sensory receptors are located in the vestibular (Scarpa’s) ganglion within the internal acoustic meatus (eFig. 9.83). The vestibular nerve then passes through the internal acoustic meatus and subarachnoid space to enter the pontomedullary junction at the cerebellopontine angle.

The central processes of the vestibular axons predominantly terminate in the four vestibular nuclei (superior, inferior, medial, and lateral), which are located in the rostral medulla and caudal pons (eFig. 9.40). Axons leaving the vestibular nuclei have several ascending and descending synaptic targets. These pathways connect with visual motor, descending motor, and cerebellar pathways to coordinate movement and maintain posture and balance (eFig. 9.84).

Axons ascending after leaving the vestibular nuclei form the medial longitudinal fasciculus to reach the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nuclei (eFig. 9.85). These connections coordinate movement of the head and eyes so that visual fixation on an object can be maintained. Other axons ascending from the vestibular nuclei project to the cerebral cortex after a synaptic relay in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (eFig. 9.84B). This connection assists in consciously orienting oneself in space. In addition to these connections, axons leaving the vestibular nuclei pass through the inferior cerebellar peduncle to reach the cerebellum and modulate equilibrium (eFig. 9.84B).

Axons descending after leaving the vestibular nuclei form the medial and lateral vestibulospinal tracts ipsilaterally (eFig. 9.84B). As mentioned in the previous section on medial motor systems in the spinal cord, the axons in these pathways synapse on interneurons within the anterior horn gray matter to influence spinal motor neuron activity and maintain posture and balance.

Part X: Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is a neuroendocrine organ that regulates physiological processes for survival such as consumption of fluid and food, temperature control, the sleep–wake cycle, growth, and reproduction. As a result of this vast array of functions, the nuclei of the hypothalamus make connections with several other neural and endocrine structures in the body (eFig. 9.86). In this section we will explore the nuclei of the hypothalamus and their main connections.

Located in the ventralmost aspect of the diencephalon, the hypothalamus is bounded by the lamina terminalis anteriorly, the hypothalamic sulcus superiorly, and the tegmentum of the midbrain posteriorly (eFig. 9.87). Laterally the hypothalamus is bordered by the substantia innominata rostrally and the posterior limb of the internal capsule caudally. It forms the floor in addition to the lower portion of the lateral walls in the third ventricle. When viewing the external surface of the ventral brain, the area containing the hypothalamus is circumscribed by the optic chiasm, optic tract, crus cerebri, and caudal edge of the mammillary bodies (eFig. 9.88).

Continuous with the hypothalamus inferiorly is the pituitary gland. These two structures are connected by the infundibulum and hypophysial stalk just caudal to the optic chiasm (eFig. 9.87). The intimate relationship of the hypothalamus to the portal circulation of the pituitary gland allows the hypothalamus to be an efficient regulator of hormone synthesis and release. Releasing and inhibiting factors synthesized by the hypothalamus pass through these portal vessels via the tuberoinfundibular tract (eFig. 9.89) to reach the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and control release of hormones produced by the anterior pituitary such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin (eFig. 9.90).

A second connection exists between the hypothalamus and pituitary through nerve fibers, which originate in the supraoptic region and paraventricular nuclei of the medial hypothalamus and extend through the hypothalamohypophyseal tract to the posterior lobe of the pituitary for release into the circulatory system (eFig. 9.89).

Internally, the hypothalamus is composed of many small nuclei, which are divided by a parasagittal plane into a medial and lateral zone. Landmarks for this dividing point are the columns of the fornix and the mammillothalamic tract as they reside within this sagittal plane (eFig. 9.91). The hypothalamus is also divided by coronal planes into a preoptic area and periventricular zone. Note that the periventricular zone is not to be confused with the paraventricular nucleus, which is a thin region of cell bodies lying medial to the medial zone.

Within the lateral zone of the hypothalamus is a large bundle of axons forming the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (eFig. 9.90). Theses fibers interconnect the hypothalamus with the septal nuclei rostrally and nuclear complexes within the brainstem. Axons arising from the large lateral nucleus in this zone enter the MFB and function in promoting feeding behavior. The other and smaller nuclear group in this zone is the tuberal group. Axons from the tuberal nuclei make connections with the anterior pituitary through the tuberoinfundibular tract to regulate release of hormones in the hypophysial portal system and to the cerebellum to regulate motor activity (eFig. 9.89).

The medial zone is divided into three regions: supraoptic, tuberal, and mammillary. There are four nuclei in the supraoptic region, which play a role in thermoregulation, osmoregulation, and the sleep–wake cycle. The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei in this region synthesize antidiuretic hormone or vasopressin, which stimulates water uptake and oxytocin for stimulation of uterine contractions and lactation in the mammary glands. Axons from these nuclei are conveyed by the hypothalamohypophyseal tract to the posterior pituitary for release into the circulatory system (eFig. 9.89). A third nuclear group in this region is the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This nucleus receives input directly from the retina to influence circadian rhythms, which contribute to the light–dark cycle. The anterior nucleus is the final group and functions predominantly in regulating body temperature.

The tuberal region in the medial zone contains three nuclei: ventromedial, dorsomedial, and arcuate. The largest and best defined is the ventromedial nucleus, which functions as a satiety center to decrease feeding behavior. Posterior to the ventromedial nucleus is the dorsomedial nucleus, which functions in the behavioral expression of rage or aggressive behavior. Finally, the arcuate nucleus serves as a center for releasing hormones, which are transmitted by the tuberoinfundibular tract and hypophysial portal system to the anterior pituitary (eFig. 9.89).

The mammillary region or mammillary body is the final group of nuclei in the medial zone. Four nuclei comprise this region: medial, intermediate, lateral mammillary, and posterior hypothalamic. The best defined is the medial mammillary nucleus, as it is the primary site for the termination of axons from the postcommissural fornix. This pathway originates from the subiculum of the hippocampal complex and plays a key role in memory. The medial mammillary nuclei also connects to structures of the limbic system.

The periventricular zone resides medial to the medial zone and adjacent to the ependymal cells of the third ventricle. Neurons from this zone predominantly synthesize releasing hormones. Axons from these neuronal cells project through the tuberoinfundibular tract to the hypophysial portal system to influence release of hormones from the anterior pituitary.

Through the review of the hypothalamus thus far, it is apparent that this small, 4-gram structure has a significant role in regulating visceral, endocrine, and behavioral system functions through multiple pathways. It is important to remember the majority of the pathways mentioned represent input–output relationships between the hypothalamus and other structures. For a review of neural and non-neural inputs and outputs, refer to the summary figures (eFig. 9.92A and B).

Part XI: Olfactory and

The sense of olfaction has a role in both pleasurable experiences and survival. The same receptors that allow us to enjoy the food we consume or experience odorants in the environment also help us avoid spoiled food or potentially hazardous situations like a fire. Unlike the other special sensory system pathways, the olfactory sensory pathway is unique in that it does not have a thalamic relay before reaching the primary olfactory cortex. In this section we will review the course of the neurons in the olfactory system and their connection to the limbic system.

Three types of olfactory receptors make up the olfactory epithelium along the lateral and septal walls of the nasal cavity. These cells allow for regeneration (basal stem cells), support (sustentacular cells), and transmission of information (olfactory receptor neurons). Each olfactory receptor neuron has an olfactory vesicle with cilia that contain receptors for odorant molecules and an unmyelinated axon that passes through the cribriform plate to terminate in the olfactory bulb (eFig. 9.93). As the olfactory receptor neurons originate embryologically from the CNS, they are considered part of the CNS and not the PNS.

After synapsing with the mitral cells in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb, mitral cell axons converge to form the olfactory tract. The olfactory tract then divides into medial and lateral olfactory striae to reach different synaptic targets (eFig. 9.94). Some of the axons in the medial olfactory striae travel through the diagonal band to reach the septal area, whereas others cross the midline in the anterior commissure and inhibit mitral cell activity in the contralateral olfactory bulb to enhance localization of the olfactory stimulant. Axons in the lateral olfactory stria primarily terminate in the piriform cortex/primary olfactory cortex of the uncus and in the amygdala (eFig. 9.94).

The medial forebrain bundle, traveling through the lateral hypothalamus, connects the olfactory cortex with both the hypothalamus and the brainstem to regulate autonomic responses such as arousal through the reticular formation, salivation, and gastric contraction.

The limbic system is composed of several cortical and subcortical structures that participate in an intricate network of connections to regulate complicated behaviors such as memory, emotions, homeostatic functions, and motivational state. In this section we will review the major structures and pathways that form the limbic system.

Grossly, the limbic lobe includes a ring-shaped area of cortical structures that border the brainstem. These cortical areas include the cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and subcallosal area (eFig. 9.12). Laterally, the insular cortex also participates in limbic system function (eFig. 9.10). Nuclear structures of the limbic system include the amygdala, hippocampal formation, anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, septal nuclei in the forebrain, and nucleus accumbens (eFig. 9.95).

The amygdaloid nucleus is an almond-shaped structure located anterior to the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle and tail of the caudate within the temporal lobe (eFig. 9.96). Structurally, the amygdala consists of three nuclear regions: a large basolateral group and a smaller corticomedial group, which includes the central nucleus. Functionally, the amygdala is primarily associated with the emotion of fear, but it also has an important role in autonomic and neuroendocrine pathways. Connections of the amygdala are predominantly bidirectional and follow three different pathways: the uncinate fasciculus, stria terminalis, and ventral amygdalofugal pathway (eFig. 9.97). Connections to cortical areas pass through the uncinate fasciculus, which progresses anterior to the amygdala. Projections to the septal area and hypothalamus follow the stria terminalis (eFig. 9.98A–D). Fibers forming the ventral amygdalofugal pathway project to thalamic nuclei and several brainstem and forebrain structures (eFig. 9.98A–D).

The nucleus accumbens resides with the ventral forebrain adjacent to where the putamen and head of the caudate become continuous with one another (eFig. 9.99). Afferent axons to the nucleus accumbens come from the amygdala through the amygdalofugal pathway, hippocampal formation by way of the fornix, basal forebrain area from the stria terminalis, and ventral tegmentum through the medial forebrain bundle (eFig. 9.98A–D). Efferent axons leaving the nucleus accumbens project directly to the hypothalamus and globus pallidus and reach nuclei in the brainstem through the medial forebrain bundle. Its connections to the globus pallidus represent an important connection of the limbic system to the motor system. The overall function of the nucleus accumbens is recognized as a gratification center and has been shown to play a role in behaviors related to addiction.

The septal region is located rostral to the anterior commissure along the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres (eFig. 9.99). This region appears to play a role in pleasurable behaviors. Conversely, lesion studies indicate that damage to this area evokes behaviors of extreme displeasure or rage. Afferent axons to the septal area arise from the amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory tract, and monoaminergic nuclei in the brainstem (eFigs. 9.100 and 9.101). The septal area also connects to a collection of cholinergic neurons along the wall and roof of the third ventricle known as the habenular nuclei. Axons from the habenular nuclei project to the interpeduncular nucleus of the reticular formation, which is believed to play a role in the sleep–wake cycle (eFig. 9.100).

The hippocampal formation is located in the medial ventral temporal lobe (eFig. 9.102). It consists of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum (eFig. 9.103A and B). The hippocampal formation plays a role in memory processes such as episodic memory, short-term memory, working memory, and consolidation of memories. Input to the hippocampal formation is primarily received by the entorhinal cortex from association cortices. Because of this, it is believed that the “storage” of memories is in the association and primary cortices, not in the medial temporal lobe. Neurons from the entorhinal cortex project to the hippocampal formation by two pathways: the perforant pathway and alvear pathway. The perforant courses directly through the hippocampal sulcus to reach the dentate gyrus (eFig. 9.104B). As the hippocampus resembles the appearance of a ram’s horn, early on it was named cornu ammonis (horn of Ammon). Based on its cytoarchitecture, it was subdivided into four regions termed the cornu ammonis 1 to 4 (eFig. 9.104A). From the dentate gyrus, axons project to CA3 of the hippocampus. Axons from the hippocampus leave via the fornix or as Shaffer collaterals to reach CA1. Axons from CA1 may enter the fornix or project to the subiculum. Finally, axons from the subiculum enter the fornix or go back to the entorhinal cortex.

A second afferent pathway from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation is through the alvear pathway. Axons in the alvear pathway project directly on to CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus (eFig. 9.104B). Similar to the perforant pathway, axons leaving the alvear pathway primarily originate from CA1 and CA3, which then project to the subiculum.

Efferent axons leaving the hippocampal formation primarily exit from the subiculum and form the fornix (Latin for “arch”), a white matter structure that arches over the ventricular system (eFig. 9.95). The fornix begins with axons exiting the hippocampus to form the alveus along the ventricular surface of the hippocampus. As the axons come together medially, they form a bundle referred to as the fimbria of the fornix. The fornix then emerges from the hippocampal formation and curves under the corpus callosum before coursing medially to run adjacent to the midline (eFig. 9.105). At the anterior commissure, the fornix divides into a precommissural fornix and postcommissural fornix to reach the nucleus accumbens, septal nuclei, medial frontal cortex, mammillary nucleus, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and anterior nucleus of the dorsal thalamus (eFig. 9.95).

Through this section we have described a collection of anatomical structures and defined their connections with other areas of the brain and brainstem without exploring how these individual structures are interconnected with one another. In the 1930s James Papez, an American neurologist, described a circuit that links these structures and cortical areas together in a way that was thought to be involved in the experience and expression of emotion. This is referred to as the Papez circuit (eFig. 9.106). The circuit begins with fibers from the subiculum, which then enter the fornix to reach the mammillary nuclei. These axons then project through the mammillothalamic tract to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Next, the axons from the anterior nucleus of the thalamus project through the internal capsule to the cingulate gyrus. Lastly, the cingulum fibers from the cingulate cortex project to the parahippocampal gyrus and then the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation (eFig. 9.106). Papez’s description of this circuit is useful for reviewing the major limbic system pathways; however, the role of some of the structures in the pathway has been shown to play little or no role in the expression of emotion. In addition, many of the structures that do play a role in the expression of emotion also have a role in other functions.

 range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane.

Movement of the stereocilia of the hair cells in the cochlea initiates neuronal transduction.

Hair cells are attached through the phalangeal cells to the basilar membrane, which vibrates during sound reception. The stereocilia of these hair cells are, in turn, attached to the tectorial membrane, which also vibrates. However, the tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane are hinged at different points. Thus, a shearing effect occurs between the basilar membrane (and the cells attached to it) and the tectorial membrane when sound vibrations impinge on the internal ear.

Because they are inserted into the tectorial membrane, the stereocilia of the hair cells are the only structures that connect the basilar membrane and its complex epithelial layer to the tectorial membrane. The shearing effect between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane deflects the stereocilia and thus the apical portion of the hair cells. This deflection activates MET channels located at the tips of stereocilia and generates action potentials that are conveyed to the brain via the cochlear nerve (cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve, cranial nerve VIII).

Innervation of the Internal Ear

The vestibular nerve originates from the sensory receptors associated with the vestibular labyrinth.

The vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) is a special sensory nerve and is composed of two divisions: A vestibular division called the vestibular nerve and a cochlear division called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve is associated with equilibrium and carries impulses from the sensory receptors located within the vestibular labyrinth. The cochlear nerve is associated with hearing and conveys  impulses from the sensory receptors within the cochlear labyrinth (Fig. 25.23).

The cell bodies of the bipolar neurons of the vestibular nerve are located in the vestibular ganglion (of Scarpa) in the internal acoustic meatus. Dendritic processes of the vestibular ganglion cells originate in the cristae ampullaris of the three semicircular ducts, the macula of the utricle, and the macula of the saccule. They synapse at the base of the vestibular sensory hair cells, either as a chalice around a type I hair cell or as a bouton associated with a type II hair cell. The axons of the vestibular nerve originate from the vestibular ganglion, enter the brain stem and terminate in four vestibular nuclei. Some secondary neuronal fibers travel to the cerebellum and to the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, which innervate the muscles of the eye.

The cochlear nerve originates from the sensory receptors of the spiral organ of Corti.

Neurons of the cochlear nerve are also bipolar, and their cell bodies are located in the spiral ganglion within the modiolus. Dendritic processes of spiral ganglion cells exit the

FIGURE 25.22 • Schematic diagram illustrating the dynamics of the three divisions of the ear. The cochlear duct is shown here as if straightened. Sound waves are collected and transmitted from the external ear to the middle ear, where they are converted into mechanical vibrations. The mechanical vibrations are then converted at the oval window into fluid vibrations within the internal ear. Fluid vibrations cause displacement of the basilar membrane (traveling wave) on which rest the auditory sensory hair cells. Such displacement leads to stimulation of the hair cells and a discharge of neural impulses from them. Note that high-frequency sounds cause vibrations of the narrow, thick portion of the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea, whereas low-frequency sounds displace basilar membrane toward the apex of the cochlea near its helicotrema.

The cochlear nerve carries the hearing impulses from the cochlear duct; the vestibular nerve carries balance information from the semicircular canals. The cell bodies of these sensory fibers are located in the spiral ganglion (for hearing) and vestibular ganglion (for equilibrium). (Modified from Hawke M, Keene M, Alberti PW. Clinical Otoscopy: A Text and Colour Atlas. Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1984.) from these nuclei pass to the geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and then to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.

It is interesting that the organ of Corti also receives small amounts of efferent fibers conveying impulses from the brain pass parallel to the afferent nerve fibers of the vestibulocochlear nerve (olivocochlear tract, cochlear efferents of Rasmussen). Efferent nerve fibers from the brain stem pass through the vestibular nerve. They synapse either on afferent endings of the inner hair cell or on the basal aspect of an outer hair cell. Efferent fibers are thought to affect control of auditory and vestibular input to the central nervous system, presumably by enhancing some afferent signals while suppressing other signals. Damage to the organ of Corti, cochlear nerve, nerve pathways, or auditory cortex is responsible for permanent sensorineural hearing loss.

Blood Vessels of the Membranous Labyrinth

Arterial blood is supplied to the membranous labyrinth by the labyrinthine artery; venous blood drainage is to the venous dural sinuses.

The blood supply to the external ear, middle ear, and bony labyrinth of the internal ear is derived from vessels associated with the external carotid arteries. The arterial blood supply to tissues of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear is derived intracranially from the labyrinthine artery, a common branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar or basilar artery (Fig. 25.24). The labyrinthine artery is a terminal artery: It has no anastomoses with other surrounding arteries. Branches of this artery exactly parallel the distribution of the superior and inferior parts of the vestibular nerve.

FIGURE 25.24 • Diagram of the arterial supply of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear. The blood supply to the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear is derived from the labyrinthine artery, a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar or basilar artery. (Modified from Schuknecht HF. Pathology of the Ear. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1974.)

Venous drainage from the cochlear labyrinth is via the posterior and anterior spiral modiolar veins that form the common modiolar vein. The common modiolar vein and the vestibulocochlear vein form the vein of the cochlear aqueduct, which empties into the inferior petrosal sinus. Venous drainage from the vestibular labyrinth is via vestibular veins that join the vein of the cochlear aqueduct and by the vein of vestibular aqueduct, which drains into the sigmoid sinus.

The internal ear, located in the temporal bone, consists of a system of chambers and canals that contain a network of membranous channels. These are referred to, respectively, as the bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth. In places, the membranous labyrinth forms the lining of the bony labyrinth; in other places, there is a separation of the two. Within the space lined by the membranous labyrinth is a watery fluid called endolymph. External to the membranous labyrinth, i.e., between the membranous and bony labyrinths, is additional fluid called perilymph. The bony labyrinth is divided into three parts: cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule. The cochlea and semicircular canals contain membranous counterparts of the same shape; however, the membranous components of the vestibule are more complex in form, being composed of ducts and two chambers, the utricle and saccule. The cochlea contains the receptors for hearing, i.e., the organ of Corti, the semicircular canals contain the receptors for movement of the head, and the utricle and saccule contain receptors for position of the head.

Internal ear, ear, guinea pig, H&E 20.

In this section through the internal ear, bone surrounds the entire internal ear cavity. Because of its labyrinthine character, sections of the internal ear appear as a number of separate chambers and ducts. These, however, are all interconnected (except that the perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces remain separate). The largest chamber is the vestibule (V ). The left side of this chamber (black arrow) leads into the cochlea (C). Just below the black arrow and to the right is the oval ligament (OL) surrounding the base of the stapes (S). Both structures have been cut obliquely and are not seen in their entirety. The facial nerve (FN ) is in an osseous tunnel to the left of the oval ligament. The com munication of the vestibule with one of the semicircular canals is marked by the white arrow. At the upper right are cross sections of the membranous labyrinth passing through components of the semicircular duct system (DS).

The cochlea is a spiral structure having the general shape of a cone. The specimen illustrated here makes 31⁄2 turns (in humans, there are 23⁄4 turns). The section goes through the central axis of the cochlea. This consists of a bony stem called the modiolus (M). It contains the beginning of the cochlear nerve (CN ) and the spiral ganglion (SG). Because of the plane of section and the spiral arrangement of the cochlear tunnel, the tunnel is cut crosswise in seven places (note 31⁄2 turns). A more detailed examination of the cochlea and the organ of Corti is provided in Plate 109.

Semicircular canal, ear, guinea pig, H&E 225.

A higher magnification of one of the semicircular canals and of the crista ampullaris (CA) within the canal seen in the lower right corner of figure above is provided here. The receptor for movement, the crista ampullaris (note its relationships in figure above), is present in each of the semicircular canals. The epithelial (EP) surface of the crista consists of two cell types, sustentacular (supporting) cells and hair (receptor) cells. (Two types of hair cells are distinguished with the electron microscope.) It is difficult to identify the hair and sustentacular cells on the basis of specific characteristics; they can, however, be distinguished on the basis of location (see inset), as the hair cells (HC) are situated in a more superficial location than the sustentacular cells (SC). A gelatinous mass, the cupula (Cu), surmounts the epithelium of the crista ampullaris. Each receptor cell sends a hair-like projection deep into the substance of the cupula.

The epithelium rests on a loose, cellular connective tissue (CT ) that also contains the nerve fibers associated with the receptor cells. The nerve fibers are difficult to identify because they are not organized into a discrete bundle.

PLATE 109 Cochlear Canal and Organ of Corti

The hair cell, a nonneuronal mechanoreceptor, is the common receptor cell of the vestibulocochlear system. Hair cells are epithelial cells that possess numerous stereocilia, modified microvilli also called sensory hairs. They convert mechanical energy to electrical energy that is transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to the brain. Hair cells are associated with afferent, as well as efferent, nerve endings. All hair cells have a common basis of receptor cell function that involves bending or flexing of their stereocilia. The specific means by which the stereocilia are bent varies from receptor to receptor, but in each case, stretching of the plasma membrane caused by the bending of the stereocilia generates transmembrane potential changes that are transmitted to the afferent nerve endings associated with each cell. Efferent nerve endings on the hair cells serve to regulate their sensitivity.

Cochlear canal, ear, guinea pig, H&E 65; inset 380.

A section through one of the turns of the cochlea is shown here. The most important functional component of the cochlea is the organ of Corti, enclosed by the rectangle and shown at higher magnification in figure below. Other structures are included in this figure. The spiral ligament (SL) is a948 thickening of the periosteum on the outer part of the tunnel. Two membranes, the basilar membrane (BM ) and the vestibular membrane (VM), join with the spiral ligament and divide the cochlear tunnel into three parallel canals, namely, the scala vestibuli (SV ), the scala tympani (ST ), and the cochlear duct (CD). Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are perilymphatic spaces; these communicate at the apex of the cochlea. The cochlear duct, on the other hand, is the space of the membranous labyrinth and is filled with endolymph. It is thought that the endolymph is formed by the portion of the spiral ligament that faces the cochlear duct, the stria vascularis (StV ). This is highly vascularized and contains specialized “secretory” cells.

A shelf of bone, the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), extends from the modiolus to the basilar membrane. Branches of the cochlear nerve (CN) travel along the spiral lamina to the modiolus, where the main trunk of the nerve is formed. The components of the cochlear nerve are bipolar neurons whose cell bodies constitute the spiral ganglion (SG). These cell bodies are shown at higher magnification in the inset (upper right). The spiral lamina supports an elevation of cells, the limbus spiralis (LS). The surface of the limbus is composed of columnar cells.

Organ of Corti, ear, guinea pig, H&E 180; inset 380.

The components of the organ of Corti, beginning at the limbus spiralis (LS), are as follows: inner border cells (IBC ); inner phalangeal and hair cells (IP&HC); inner pillar cells (IPC ); (the sequence continues, repeating itself in reverse) outer pillar cells (OPC ); hair cells (HC ) and outer phalangeal cells (OP); and outer border cells or cells of Hensen (CH ). Hair cells are receptor cells; the other cells are collectively referred to as supporting cells. The hair and outer phalangeal cells can be distinguished in this figure by their location (see inset) and because their nuclei are well aligned. Because the hair cells rest on the phalangeal cells, it can be concluded that the upper three nuclei belong to outer hair cells, whereas the lower three nuclei belong to outer phalangeal cells.

The supporting cells extend from the basilar membrane (BM) to the surface of the organ of Corti (this is not evident here but can be seen in the inset), where they form a reticular membrane (RM). The free surface of the receptor cells fits into openings in the reticular membrane, and the “hairs” of these cells project toward, and make contact with, the tectorial membrane (TM ). The latter is a cuticular extension from the columnar cells of the limbus spiralis. In ideal preparations, nerve fibers can be traced from the hair cells to the cochlear nerve (CN).

In their course from the basilar membrane to the reticular membrane, groups of supporting cells are separated from other groups by spaces that form spiral tunnels. These tunnels are named the inner tunnel (IT ), the outer tunnel (OT ), and the internal spiral tunnel (IST ). Beyond the supporting cells are two additional groups of cells, the cells of Claudius (CC) and the cells of Btcher (CB).

ysis, so advanced imaging may be needed. The most helpful form of advanced imaging among CT, bone scan, single-photon emission CT (SPECT), or MRI continues to be debated. MRI may be required in patients with neurologic deficits.

Painful spondylolysis requires activity restriction. Bracing iscontroversial but may help with pain relief. Patients benefit froman aggressive physical therapy plan to improve lower extremityflexibility and increase core strength and spinal stability. It is most beneficial to begin with flexion exercises and progress toextension exercises as tolerated. There is evidence that some patients with an acute spondylolysis can achieve bony unionand that these patients have a decreased incidence of low backpain and degenerative change in the low back as they age whencompared with spondylolysis patients with nonunion. Rarely,surgery is indicated for intractable pain and disability.

Patients with spondylolisthesis require periodic evaluation for progression of their slippage. Treatment of spondylolisthesis is based on grading.

Grade 1: Same treatment as spondylolysis. Failure of nonoperative management may lead to surgical fusion.Grade 2: Reasonable to try nonoperative management, but if the slippage is progressing, surgical intervention may be needed. Any patient with neurologic symptoms requires surgical intervention.Grades 3 to 5: Spinal fusion is usually required to prevent further slippage or damage.

Diskitis is an intervertebral disk space infection that does not cause associated vertebral osteomyelitis (see Chapter 117). The most common organism is Staphylococcus aureus. The infection can occur at any age but is more common in patients under 6 years of age.

Children may present with back pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, irritability, and refusal to walk or sit. Fever is an inconsistent symptom. The child typically holds the spine in a straight or stiff position, generally has a loss of lumbar lordosis due to paravertebral muscular spasm, and refuses to flex the lumbar spine. The white blood cell count is normal or elevated, but the ESR and CRP are usually high.

Radiographic findings vary according to the duration of symptoms before diagnosis. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the lumbar or thoracic spine will typically show a narrow disk space with irregularity of the adjacent vertebral body end plates. In early cases, bone scan or MRI may be helpful, because they will be positive before findings are noticeable on plain radiographs. MRI can also be used to differentiate between diskitis and the more serious condition of vertebral osteomyelitis.

Intravenous antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Blood cultures may occasionally be positive and identify the infectious agent. Aspiration and needle biopsy are reserved for children who are not responding to empirical antibiotic treatment. Symptoms should resolve rapidly with antibiotics, but intravenous antibiotics should be continued for 1 to 2 weeks and be followed by 4 weeks of oral antibiotics. Pain control can be obtained with medications and temporary orthotic immobilization of the back.

The shoulder actually comprises four joints:Glenohumeral joint (commonly referred to as the shoulder

The glenohumeral joint has minimal geometric stability because the relatively small glenoid fossa articulates with the proportionately larger head of the humerus. The low level of intrinsic stability allows for a large range of motion. The rotator cuff muscles help give the glenohumeral joint more stability, but they need normal contact of the glenohumeral joint to be successful. The scapulothoracic movement also expands the range of motion of the shoulder, but like the glenohumeral joint, it requires strong, coordinated musculature to function efficiently.

Sprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. There are varying degrees of severity; it is usually unilateral. There is restricted scapulothoracic motion (especially with abduction) so most of the shoulder motion is through the glenohumeral joint. There is usually associated hypoplasia of the parascapular muscles. Webbing of the neck and low posterior hairline can be associated problems. There is an association with congenital syndromes, such as Klippel-Feil anomaly, so a thorough history and examination are necessary. Mild forms with a cosmetic deformity and mild loss of shoulder motion do not need surgical correction. Severe forms may have a bony connection (omovertebral) between the scapula and lower cervical spine. Moderate and severe forms may need surgical repositioning of the scapula in early childhood to improve cosmesis and function.

Obstetric brachial plexus palsy is discussed in Section 11. Brachial plexopathy is an athletic injury, commonly referred to as a stinger or burner. The symptoms are often likened to a dead arm. There is pain (often burning), weakness, and numbness in a single upper extremity. There are three mechanisms of injury:Traction caused by lateral flexion of the neck away from the involved upper extremityDirect impact to the brachial plexus at Erb’s pointCompression caused by neck extension and rotation toward the involved extremity

Symptoms are always unilateral and should resolve within 15 minutes. It is paramount to assess the cervical spine for serious injury. Bilateral symptoms, lower extremity symptoms, persistent symptoms, or recurrent injury are all signs of more serious disease and may need a more extensive workup and cervical spine stabilization. Athletes may return to activity if there are no red flags on history or physical examination and the athlete has full pain-free range of motion and strength in the neck and affected extremity.

Shoulder dislocation is uncommon in childhood but becomes more frequent in adolescence. The younger the patient is at presentation, the more likely it is that the patient will have recurrent dislocation. Anterior dislocation is the most common. If assessment of the neurovascular status of the affected extremity reveals any compromise, urgent reduction is needed to prevent further complications. Patients will need radiographs to assess for fractures of the glenoid (Bankhart lesion) and humeral head (Hill-Sachs lesion). Most patients will require a brief period of protection in a sling or shoulder immobilizer, as well as pain control. As symptoms resolve, a gentle range-of-motion program, followed by an aggressive strengthening program, should be done. Recurrence occurs in nearly 90% of athletes participating in contact sports, so orthopedists consider surgical intervention early rather than awaiting further dislocation.

The incidence of overuse injuries is increasing because of increased opportunities for athletic participation as well as higher levels of intensity during sports. Overuse injuries are inflammatory responses in tendons and bursae that are subjected to repetitive motions and trauma (e.g., rotator cufftendinopathy in swimmers). These injuries are uncommon in children but may be seen in adolescents. Bony injury, such as physeal fractures and apophysitis, must be ruled out before making the diagnosis of a soft tissue overuse injury. Many overuse injuries in the shoulder, such as rotator cuff tendinopathy, are secondary to joint laxity.

The patient will often present with discomfort over the affected area that worsens with activity. Physical examination usually reveals tenderness to palpation and often weakness of the associated muscles due to pain. It is important to assess for glenohumeral stability. Radiographs may be indicated for acute trauma or when symptoms are not improving. Treatment consists of activity modification, icing, anti-inflammatory medication, and a physical therapy program aimed at strengthening, increasing flexibility, and improving posture.

Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis is commonly referred to as Little Leaguer’s shoulder. It most commonly occurs in 9to 14-year-olds who participate in overhead (tennis, volleyball) and throwing sports, particularly baseball pitchers. It is a stress injury that potentially can be a fracture (epiphysiolysis) of the proximal humeral physis. Most patients present with pain during or after throwing. There may be tenderness to palpation over the proximal humerus; if the athlete has been resting for a few days, examination may be normal. Radiographs should include comparison views to assess the physis. There may be widening of the proximal humeral physis in the affected arm, but the films may be normal. Treatment is rest from the offending activity, followed by a rehabilitation program designed to improve strength in the shoulder muscles. Pitchers should also be encouraged to follow youth pitching guidelines published by Little League baseball.

The elbow consists of three articulations: Ulnar-humeral jointRadial-humeral jointProximal radioulnar jointCollectively, these joints produce a hinge-type joint that allows for supination (palm up) and pronation (palm down) positioning of the hand. The elbow has excellent geometric stability, and the musculature around the elbow primarily produces flexion and extension.

Radial head subluxation is more commonly known as nursemaid’s elbow. Because the radial head is not as bulbous in infants and young children, the annular ligament that passes around it can partially slip off the radial head with traction across the elbow (Fig. 203-1). The subluxation is usually caused by a quick pull on the extended elbow when a child is forcefully lifted by the hand or when the child falls while holding hands with an adult. After a subluxation, the child usually holds the hand in a pronated position and will refuse to use the hand or move the elbow. Moving the hand into the supinated position while applying pressure to the radial head will usually reduce the injury. Usually, radiographs are not necessary unless reduction cannot be obtained or there is concern for fracture (swelling and bruising). Once the injury is reduced, the child will begin using the arm again without complaint. Parents should be educated about the mechanism of injury and encouraged to avoid that position. There is a high rate of recurrence for this injury. The problem generally resolves with

Figure 203-1 Nursemaid’s elbow. The annular ligament is torn when the arm is pulled. The radial head moves distally, and when traction is discontinued, the ligament is carried into the joint. (From Rang M: Children’s Fractures, Philadelphia, 1974, JB Lippincott, p 121.) maturation, but some children with high recurrence rates may benefit from casting or, rarely, surgical intervention.

Panner disease is an osteochondritis of the capitellum (lateral portion of distal humeral epiphysis) that occurs spontaneously in late childhood. Clinical features include elbow pain, decreased range of motion, and tenderness to palpation over the capitellum. Radiographs reveal fragmentation of the capitellum. Treatment is activity restriction and follow-up radiographs to demonstrate spontaneous reossification of the capitellum over several months. There is usually no need for further treatment or imaging studies. This is not to be confused with osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, which usually will occur in adolescents involved with throwing sports.

The elbow is especially vulnerable to throwing injuries in theskeletally immature athlete. These occur from excessive andrepetitive tension forces across the radial aspect of the elbow andcompression forces across the lateral aspect of the elbow. Theseinjuries are commonly known as Little Leaguer’s elbow.

Although this injury is most common in baseball players who throw frequently (pitcher, catcher, third base, and shortstop), it also occurs in football quarterbacks and tennis players. Patients will usually complain of pain over the medial elbow with throwing that may last for a few days afterward. There may be associated swelling and lateral or posterior elbow pain. Radiation of pain may be secondary to ulnar neuropathy. There is often a flexion contracture of the elbow when compared to the opposite side. Palpation of the medial epicondyle, radial head, capitellum, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon process often reveals tenderness. Ulnar (medial) collateral ligament stability should be assessed. Radiographs should include the contralateral elbow for comparison. Radiographic findings in Little Leaguer’s elbow can vary and may include normal anatomy, medial humeral epicondyle apophyseal avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial head abnormalities, and foreign bodies in the elbow. MRI may be helpful.

Treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis but always includes pain control and rest from activity. Classic Little Leaguer’s elbow refers to medial humeral epicondyle apophysitis. These athletes benefit from rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medication, and a physical therapy program aimed at upper body strengthening. Throwing mechanics and the pitching guidelines published by Little League Baseball/Softball should be reviewed with these players. Switching players to a lower throwing position (e.g., first base) after rehabilitation, to avoid pitching for the remainder of the season, is often recommended.

Multiple small joints, a delicately balanced intrinsic muscle system, a powerful extrinsic muscle system, dense sensory innervation, and specialized skin combine to make the hand a highlymobile and sensitive yet powerful anatomic part. The extrinsicmuscles originate in the forearm and the intrinsic muscles arelocated in the hand and coordinate small, delicate movements. The movements of opening the hand, extending and spreading the fingers, and then clenching the hand into a fist requirescoordinated function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Tenderness of direct palpation of the bones raises the concern for fracture. Scaphoid fracture is the most common carpal bonefracture in the pediatric population. It requires immobilizationin a thumb spica cast, whereas displaced fractures require surgical intervention. Salter-Harris fractures of the distal radius are also very common. In young gymnasts, there is increased riskfor injury at the distal radial physis from repetitive impact andupper extremity weight bearing. This is commonly called gymnast’s wrist and requires absolute rest from impact and weightbearing to prevent premature closure of the growth plate.

Ganglion cysts are synovial fluid-filled cysts about the wrist. The most common location is the dorsum of the wrist near the radiocarpal joint, followed by the volar radial aspect of the wrist. The defect is in the joint capsule, which allows synovial fluid into the soft tissues with wrist use, where it can become walled off with fibrous tissue. Often, in skeletally immature patients, the process is benign and disappears over time. Large ganglion cysts or cysts that are painful and interfere with function may require more aggressive therapy. Aspiration and steroid injection into the cyst may be helpful, but many will recur. Surgical excision will remove the tract that attaches to the wrist joint, so it is usually curative.

Polydactyly (extra digits) occurs in simple and complex varieties (see Table 201-2). Skin tags and digit remnants that occur near the metacarpophalangeal joint of the fifth digit and thumb that do not have palpable bones or possess voluntary motion are simple varieties. These may be excised or ligated in the nursery. Complex deformities should be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for amputation. Syndactyly (fused digits) are concerning because of the possibility of shared structures and the tethering effects on bone growth (see Table 201-2). All patients with syndactyly should be referred for treatment options.

Trigger thumb and trigger finger are secondary to isolated thickening of the flexor tendons. As the thickened nodule enlarges, it may catch in a bent position, then snap or triggerstraight as it passes through the first pulley that anchors the tendon. Ultimately, as it enlarges, it cannot pass through at all and produces a flexion deformity at the interphalangeal joints. The nodule may be palpable near the metacarpophalangeal joint. These children should be referred for surgical correction.

Benign bone tumors and cystic lesions are common in childhood. Some represent fibrous dysplasia. Others are benign bone cysts (unicameral) or benign bone tumors (osteoid osteoma). Subacute osteomyelitis (Brodie abscess) and eosinophilic granulomas are lesions not associated with abnormal bone or cartilage growth. Some of these lesions can produce pain, limp, and pathologic fractures. Others can be incidental findings on radiographs. The prognosis is usually excellent. A brief differential diagnosis of bone tumors and their management is listed in Table 204-1. Malignant bone tumors are discussed in Section 21.

hypersensitivity reactions to immune globulin that may limit therapy. Conventional immune globulin contains aggregates of IgG; it will cause severe reactions if given intravenously. However, if the passively administered antibodies are derived from animal sera, hypersensitivity reactions ranging from anaphylaxis to serum sickness may occur. Highly purified immunoglobulins, especially from rodents or lagomorphs, are the least likely to cause reactions. To avoid anaphylactic reactions, tests for hypersensitivity to the animal serum must be performed. If an alternative preparation is not available and administration of the specific antibody is deemed essential, desensitization can be carried out.

Antibodies derived from human serum not only avoid the risk of hypersensitivity reactions but also have a much longer half-life in humans (about 23 days for IgG antibodies) than those from animal sources (5–7 days or less). Consequently, much smaller doses of human antibody can be administered to provide therapeutic concentrations for several weeks. These advantages point to the desirability of using human antibodies for passive protection

whenever possible. Materials available for passive immunization are summarized in Table A–3.

It is the physician’s responsibility to inform the patient of the risk of immunization and to use vaccines and antisera in an appropriate manner. This may require skin testing to assess the risk of an untoward reaction. Some of the risks previously described are, however, currently unavoidable; on balance, the patient and society are clearly better off accepting the risks for routinely administered immunogens (eg, influenza and tetanus vaccines).

Manufacturers should be held legally accountable for failure to adhere to existing standards for production of biologicals. However, in the present litigious atmosphere of the USA, the filing of large liability claims by the statistically inevitable victims of good public health practice has caused many manufacturers to abandon efforts to develop and produce low-profit but medically valuable therapeutic agents such as vaccines. Since the use and sale of these products are subject to careful review and approval by government bodies such as the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the US Food and Drug Administration, “strict product liability” (liability without fault) may be an inappropriate legal standard to apply when rare reactions to biologicals, produced and administered according to government guidelines, are involved.

Every adult, whether traveling or not, should be immunized with tetanus toxoid and should also be fully immunized against poliomyelitis, measles (for those born after 1956), and diphtheria. In addition, every traveler must fulfill the immunization requirements of the health authorities of the countries to be visited. These are listed in Health Information for International Travel, available from the Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. A useful website is http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/. The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics also offers periodically updated recommendations for international travelers (see Treatment Guidelines from The Medical Letter, 2012;10:45). Immunizations received in preparation for travel should be recorded on the International Certificate of Immunization. Note: Smallpox vaccination is not recommended or required for travel in any country.
