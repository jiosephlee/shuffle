 range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane.

Movement of the stereocilia of the hair cells in the cochlea initiates neuronal transduction.

Hair cells are attached through the phalangeal cells to the basilar membrane, which vibrates during sound reception. The stereocilia of these hair cells are, in turn, attached to the tectorial membrane, which also vibrates. However, the tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane are hinged at different points. Thus, a shearing effect occurs between the basilar membrane (and the cells attached to it) and the tectorial membrane when sound vibrations impinge on the internal ear.

Because they are inserted into the tectorial membrane, the stereocilia of the hair cells are the only structures that connect the basilar membrane and its complex epithelial layer to the tectorial membrane. The shearing effect between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane deflects the stereocilia and thus the apical portion of the hair cells. This deflection activates MET channels located at the tips of stereocilia and generates action potentials that are conveyed to the brain via the cochlear nerve (cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve, cranial nerve VIII).

Innervation of the Internal Ear

The vestibular nerve originates from the sensory receptors associated with the vestibular labyrinth.

The vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) is a special sensory nerve and is composed of two divisions: A vestibular division called the vestibular nerve and a cochlear division called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve is associated with equilibrium and carries impulses from the sensory receptors located within the vestibular labyrinth. The cochlear nerve is associated with hearing and conveys  impulses from the sensory receptors within the cochlear labyrinth (Fig. 25.23).

The cell bodies of the bipolar neurons of the vestibular nerve are located in the vestibular ganglion (of Scarpa) in the internal acoustic meatus. Dendritic processes of the vestibular ganglion cells originate in the cristae ampullaris of the three semicircular ducts, the macula of the utricle, and the macula of the saccule. They synapse at the base of the vestibular sensory hair cells, either as a chalice around a type I hair cell or as a bouton associated with a type II hair cell. The axons of the vestibular nerve originate from the vestibular ganglion, enter the brain stem and terminate in four vestibular nuclei. Some secondary neuronal fibers travel to the cerebellum and to the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, which innervate the muscles of the eye.

The cochlear nerve originates from the sensory receptors of the spiral organ of Corti.

Neurons of the cochlear nerve are also bipolar, and their cell bodies are located in the spiral ganglion within the modiolus. Dendritic processes of spiral ganglion cells exit the

FIGURE 25.22 • Schematic diagram illustrating the dynamics of the three divisions of the ear. The cochlear duct is shown here as if straightened. Sound waves are collected and transmitted from the external ear to the middle ear, where they are converted into mechanical vibrations. The mechanical vibrations are then converted at the oval window into fluid vibrations within the internal ear. Fluid vibrations cause displacement of the basilar membrane (traveling wave) on which rest the auditory sensory hair cells. Such displacement leads to stimulation of the hair cells and a discharge of neural impulses from them. Note that high-frequency sounds cause vibrations of the narrow, thick portion of the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea, whereas low-frequency sounds displace basilar membrane toward the apex of the cochlea near its helicotrema.

FIGURE 25.23 • Diagram illustrating the innervation of the sensory regions of the membranous labyrinth. Note the two parts of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The cochlear nerve carries the hearing impulses from the cochlear duct; the vestibular nerve carries balance information from the semicircular canals. The cell bodies of these sensory fibers are located in the spiral ganglion (for hearing) and vestibular ganglion (for equilibrium). (Modified from Hawke M, Keene M, Alberti PW. Clinical Otoscopy: A Text and Colour Atlas. Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone, 1984.) from these nuclei pass to the geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and then to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.

It is interesting that the organ of Corti also receives small amounts of efferent fibers conveying impulses from the brain pass parallel to the afferent nerve fibers of the vestibulocochlear nerve (olivocochlear tract, cochlear efferents of Rasmussen). Efferent nerve fibers from the brain stem pass through the vestibular nerve. They synapse either on afferent endings of the inner hair cell or on the basal aspect of an outer hair cell. Efferent fibers are thought to affect control of auditory and vestibular input to the central nervous system, presumably by enhancing some afferent signals while suppressing other signals. Damage to the organ of Corti, cochlear nerve, nerve pathways, or auditory cortex is responsible for permanent sensorineural hearing loss.

Blood Vessels of the Membranous Labyrinth

Arterial blood is supplied to the membranous labyrinth by the labyrinthine artery; venous blood drainage is to the venous dural sinuses.

The blood supply to the external ear, middle ear, and bony labyrinth of the internal ear is derived from vessels associated with the external carotid arteries. The arterial blood supply to tissues of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear is derived intracranially from the labyrinthine artery, a common branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar or basilar artery (Fig. 25.24). The labyrinthine artery is a terminal artery: It has no anastomoses with other surrounding arteries. Branches of this artery exactly parallel the distribution of the superior and inferior parts of the vestibular nerve.

FIGURE 25.24 • Diagram of the arterial supply of the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear. The blood supply to the membranous labyrinth of the internal ear is derived from the labyrinthine artery, a branch of the anterior inferior cerebellar or basilar artery. (Modified from Schuknecht HF. Pathology of the Ear. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1974.)

Venous drainage from the cochlear labyrinth is via the posterior and anterior spiral modiolar veins that form the common modiolar vein. The common modiolar vein and the vestibulocochlear vein form the vein of the cochlear aqueduct, which empties into the inferior petrosal sinus. Venous drainage from the vestibular labyrinth is via vestibular veins that join the vein of the cochlear aqueduct and by the vein of vestibular aqueduct, which drains into the sigmoid sinus.

The internal ear, located in the temporal bone, consists of a system of chambers and canals that contain a network of membranous channels. These are referred to, respectively, as the bony labyrinth and membranous labyrinth. In places, the membranous labyrinth forms the lining of the bony labyrinth; in other places, there is a separation of the two. Within the space lined by the membranous labyrinth is a watery fluid called endolymph. External to the membranous labyrinth, i.e., between the membranous and bony labyrinths, is additional fluid called perilymph. The bony labyrinth is divided into three parts: cochlea, semicircular canals, and vestibule. The cochlea and semicircular canals contain membranous counterparts of the same shape; however, the membranous components of the vestibule are more complex in form, being composed of ducts and two chambers, the utricle and saccule. The cochlea contains the receptors for hearing, i.e., the organ of Corti, the semicircular canals contain the receptors for movement of the head, and the utricle and saccule contain receptors for position of the head.

Internal ear, ear, guinea pig, H&E 20.

In this section through the internal ear, bone surrounds the entire internal ear cavity. Because of its labyrinthine character, sections of the internal ear appear as a number of separate chambers and ducts. These, however, are all interconnected (except that the perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces remain separate). The largest chamber is the vestibule (V ). The left side of this chamber (black arrow) leads into the cochlea (C). Just below the black arrow and to the right is the oval ligament (OL) surrounding the base of the stapes (S). Both structures have been cut obliquely and are not seen in their entirety. The facial nerve (FN ) is in an osseous tunnel to the left of the oval ligament. The com munication of the vestibule with one of the semicircular canals is marked by the white arrow. At the upper right are cross sections of the membranous labyrinth passing through components of the semicircular duct system (DS).

The cochlea is a spiral structure having the general shape of a cone. The specimen illustrated here makes 31⁄2 turns (in humans, there are 23⁄4 turns). The section goes through the central axis of the cochlea. This consists of a bony stem called the modiolus (M). It contains the beginning of the cochlear nerve (CN ) and the spiral ganglion (SG). Because of the plane of section and the spiral arrangement of the cochlear tunnel, the tunnel is cut crosswise in seven places (note 31⁄2 turns). A more detailed examination of the cochlea and the organ of Corti is provided in Plate 109.

Semicircular canal, ear, guinea pig, H&E 225.

A higher magnification of one of the semicircular canals and of the crista ampullaris (CA) within the canal seen in the lower right corner of figure above is provided here. The receptor for movement, the crista ampullaris (note its relationships in figure above), is present in each of the semicircular canals. The epithelial (EP) surface of the crista consists of two cell types, sustentacular (supporting) cells and hair (receptor) cells. (Two types of hair cells are distinguished with the electron microscope.) It is difficult to identify the hair and sustentacular cells on the basis of specific characteristics; they can, however, be distinguished on the basis of location (see inset), as the hair cells (HC) are situated in a more superficial location than the sustentacular cells (SC). A gelatinous mass, the cupula (Cu), surmounts the epithelium of the crista ampullaris. Each receptor cell sends a hair-like projection deep into the substance of the cupula.

The epithelium rests on a loose, cellular connective tissue (CT ) that also contains the nerve fibers associated with the receptor cells. The nerve fibers are difficult to identify because they are not organized into a discrete bundle.

PLATE 109 Cochlear Canal and Organ of Corti

The hair cell, a nonneuronal mechanoreceptor, is the common receptor cell of the vestibulocochlear system. Hair cells are epithelial cells that possess numerous stereocilia, modified microvilli also called sensory hairs. They convert mechanical energy to electrical energy that is transmitted via the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to the brain. Hair cells are associated with afferent, as well as efferent, nerve endings. All hair cells have a common basis of receptor cell function that involves bending or flexing of their stereocilia. The specific means by which the stereocilia are bent varies from receptor to receptor, but in each case, stretching of the plasma membrane caused by the bending of the stereocilia generates transmembrane potential changes that are transmitted to the afferent nerve endings associated with each cell. Efferent nerve endings on the hair cells serve to regulate their sensitivity.

Cochlear canal, ear, guinea pig, H&E 65; inset 380.

A section through one of the turns of the cochlea is shown here. The most important functional component of the cochlea is the organ of Corti, enclosed by the rectangle and shown at higher magnification in figure below. Other structures are included in this figure. The spiral ligament (SL) is a948 thickening of the periosteum on the outer part of the tunnel. Two membranes, the basilar membrane (BM ) and the vestibular membrane (VM), join with the spiral ligament and divide the cochlear tunnel into three parallel canals, namely, the scala vestibuli (SV ), the scala tympani (ST ), and the cochlear duct (CD). Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani are perilymphatic spaces; these communicate at the apex of the cochlea. The cochlear duct, on the other hand, is the space of the membranous labyrinth and is filled with endolymph. It is thought that the endolymph is formed by the portion of the spiral ligament that faces the cochlear duct, the stria vascularis (StV ). This is highly vascularized and contains specialized “secretory” cells.

A shelf of bone, the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), extends from the modiolus to the basilar membrane. Branches of the cochlear nerve (CN) travel along the spiral lamina to the modiolus, where the main trunk of the nerve is formed. The components of the cochlear nerve are bipolar neurons whose cell bodies constitute the spiral ganglion (SG). These cell bodies are shown at higher magnification in the inset (upper right). The spiral lamina supports an elevation of cells, the limbus spiralis (LS). The surface of the limbus is composed of columnar cells.

Organ of Corti, ear, guinea pig, H&E 180; inset 380.

The components of the organ of Corti, beginning at the limbus spiralis (LS), are as follows: inner border cells (IBC ); inner phalangeal and hair cells (IP&HC); inner pillar cells (IPC ); (the sequence continues, repeating itself in reverse) outer pillar cells (OPC ); hair cells (HC ) and outer phalangeal cells (OP); and outer border cells or cells of Hensen (CH ). Hair cells are receptor cells; the other cells are collectively referred to as supporting cells. The hair and outer phalangeal cells can be distinguished in this figure by their location (see inset) and because their nuclei are well aligned. Because the hair cells rest on the phalangeal cells, it can be concluded that the upper three nuclei belong to outer hair cells, whereas the lower three nuclei belong to outer phalangeal cells.

The supporting cells extend from the basilar membrane (BM) to the surface of the organ of Corti (this is not evident here but can be seen in the inset), where they form a reticular membrane (RM). The free surface of the receptor cells fits into openings in the reticular membrane, and the “hairs” of these cells project toward, and make contact with, the tectorial membrane (TM ). The latter is a cuticular extension from the columnar cells of the limbus spiralis. In ideal preparations, nerve fibers can be traced from the hair cells to the cochlear nerve (CN).

In their course from the basilar membrane to the reticular membrane, groups of supporting cells are separated from other groups by spaces that form spiral tunnels. These tunnels are named the inner tunnel (IT ), the outer tunnel (OT ), and the internal spiral tunnel (IST ). Beyond the supporting cells are two additional groups of cells, the cells of Claudius (CC) and the cells of Btcher (CB).
