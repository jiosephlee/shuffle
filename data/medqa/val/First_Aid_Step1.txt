 few to be chewed and digested.” “Always read something that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.” —P.J. O’Rourke “So many books, so little time.” “If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all.” to Use the  Database 712 `Anatomy,

Embryology, and Neuroscience 715

This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample examination books, software, websites, and apps that have been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First Author (or editor), the Current Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Number of Pages, the Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.

For a complete list of resources, including summaries that describe their overall style and utility, go to www.firstaidteam.com/bonus

A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as follows:

The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including:

The cost

The readability of the text or usability of the app

The appropriateness and accuracy of the material

The quality and number of sample questions

The quality of written answers to sample questions

The quality and appropriateness of the illustrations (eg, graphs, diagrams, photographs)

The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)

The quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline

The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1

Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks available in the basic sciences.

Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the country. The ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited student feedback on any particular resource.

Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:

Publishers’ prices change frequently.

Bookstores often charge an additional markup.

New editions come out frequently, and the quality of updating varies.

The same book may be reissued through another publisher.

We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update our database. (See p. xvii, How to Contribute.) In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews of new books or suggestions for alternate modes of study that may be useful in preparing for the examination, such as flash cards, computer software, commercial review courses, apps, and websites.

Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement

No material in this book, including the ratings, reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention of the authors through our blog at www.firstaidteam.com.

Please note that USMLE-Rx and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series are publications by certain authors of this book; the following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student authors of this book as well as data from the student survey and feedback forms.
