ysis, so advanced imaging may be needed. The most helpful form of advanced imaging among CT, bone scan, single-photon emission CT (SPECT), or MRI continues to be debated. MRI may be required in patients with neurologic deficits.

Painful spondylolysis requires activity restriction. Bracing iscontroversial but may help with pain relief. Patients benefit froman aggressive physical therapy plan to improve lower extremityflexibility and increase core strength and spinal stability. It is most beneficial to begin with flexion exercises and progress toextension exercises as tolerated. There is evidence that some patients with an acute spondylolysis can achieve bony unionand that these patients have a decreased incidence of low backpain and degenerative change in the low back as they age whencompared with spondylolysis patients with nonunion. Rarely,surgery is indicated for intractable pain and disability.

Patients with spondylolisthesis require periodic evaluation for progression of their slippage. Treatment of spondylolisthesis is based on grading.

Grade 1: Same treatment as spondylolysis. Failure of nonoperative management may lead to surgical fusion.Grade 2: Reasonable to try nonoperative management, but if the slippage is progressing, surgical intervention may be needed. Any patient with neurologic symptoms requires surgical intervention.Grades 3 to 5: Spinal fusion is usually required to prevent further slippage or damage.

Diskitis is an intervertebral disk space infection that does not cause associated vertebral osteomyelitis (see Chapter 117). The most common organism is Staphylococcus aureus. The infection can occur at any age but is more common in patients under 6 years of age.

Children may present with back pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, irritability, and refusal to walk or sit. Fever is an inconsistent symptom. The child typically holds the spine in a straight or stiff position, generally has a loss of lumbar lordosis due to paravertebral muscular spasm, and refuses to flex the lumbar spine. The white blood cell count is normal or elevated, but the ESR and CRP are usually high.

Radiographic findings vary according to the duration of symptoms before diagnosis. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the lumbar or thoracic spine will typically show a narrow disk space with irregularity of the adjacent vertebral body end plates. In early cases, bone scan or MRI may be helpful, because they will be positive before findings are noticeable on plain radiographs. MRI can also be used to differentiate between diskitis and the more serious condition of vertebral osteomyelitis.

Intravenous antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Blood cultures may occasionally be positive and identify the infectious agent. Aspiration and needle biopsy are reserved for children who are not responding to empirical antibiotic treatment. Symptoms should resolve rapidly with antibiotics, but intravenous antibiotics should be continued for 1 to 2 weeks and be followed by 4 weeks of oral antibiotics. Pain control can be obtained with medications and temporary orthotic immobilization of the back.

The shoulder actually comprises four joints:Glenohumeral joint (commonly referred to as the shoulder

The glenohumeral joint has minimal geometric stability because the relatively small glenoid fossa articulates with the proportionately larger head of the humerus. The low level of intrinsic stability allows for a large range of motion. The rotator cuff muscles help give the glenohumeral joint more stability, but they need normal contact of the glenohumeral joint to be successful. The scapulothoracic movement also expands the range of motion of the shoulder, but like the glenohumeral joint, it requires strong, coordinated musculature to function efficiently.

Sprengel deformity is the congenital elevation of the scapula. There are varying degrees of severity; it is usually unilateral. There is restricted scapulothoracic motion (especially with abduction) so most of the shoulder motion is through the glenohumeral joint. There is usually associated hypoplasia of the parascapular muscles. Webbing of the neck and low posterior hairline can be associated problems. There is an association with congenital syndromes, such as Klippel-Feil anomaly, so a thorough history and examination are necessary. Mild forms with a cosmetic deformity and mild loss of shoulder motion do not need surgical correction. Severe forms may have a bony connection (omovertebral) between the scapula and lower cervical spine. Moderate and severe forms may need surgical repositioning of the scapula in early childhood to improve cosmesis and function.

Obstetric brachial plexus palsy is discussed in Section 11. Brachial plexopathy is an athletic injury, commonly referred to as a stinger or burner. The symptoms are often likened to a dead arm. There is pain (often burning), weakness, and numbness in a single upper extremity. There are three mechanisms of injury:Traction caused by lateral flexion of the neck away from the involved upper extremityDirect impact to the brachial plexus at Erb’s pointCompression caused by neck extension and rotation toward the involved extremity

Symptoms are always unilateral and should resolve within 15 minutes. It is paramount to assess the cervical spine for serious injury. Bilateral symptoms, lower extremity symptoms, persistent symptoms, or recurrent injury are all signs of more serious disease and may need a more extensive workup and cervical spine stabilization. Athletes may return to activity if there are no red flags on history or physical examination and the athlete has full pain-free range of motion and strength in the neck and affected extremity.

Shoulder dislocation is uncommon in childhood but becomes more frequent in adolescence. The younger the patient is at presentation, the more likely it is that the patient will have recurrent dislocation. Anterior dislocation is the most common. If assessment of the neurovascular status of the affected extremity reveals any compromise, urgent reduction is needed to prevent further complications. Patients will need radiographs to assess for fractures of the glenoid (Bankhart lesion) and humeral head (Hill-Sachs lesion). Most patients will require a brief period of protection in a sling or shoulder immobilizer, as well as pain control. As symptoms resolve, a gentle range-of-motion program, followed by an aggressive strengthening program, should be done. Recurrence occurs in nearly 90% of athletes participating in contact sports, so orthopedists consider surgical intervention early rather than awaiting further dislocation.

The incidence of overuse injuries is increasing because of increased opportunities for athletic participation as well as higher levels of intensity during sports. Overuse injuries are inflammatory responses in tendons and bursae that are subjected to repetitive motions and trauma (e.g., rotator cufftendinopathy in swimmers). These injuries are uncommon in children but may be seen in adolescents. Bony injury, such as physeal fractures and apophysitis, must be ruled out before making the diagnosis of a soft tissue overuse injury. Many overuse injuries in the shoulder, such as rotator cuff tendinopathy, are secondary to joint laxity.

The patient will often present with discomfort over the affected area that worsens with activity. Physical examination usually reveals tenderness to palpation and often weakness of the associated muscles due to pain. It is important to assess for glenohumeral stability. Radiographs may be indicated for acute trauma or when symptoms are not improving. Treatment consists of activity modification, icing, anti-inflammatory medication, and a physical therapy program aimed at strengthening, increasing flexibility, and improving posture.

Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis is commonly referred to as Little Leaguer’s shoulder. It most commonly occurs in 9to 14-year-olds who participate in overhead (tennis, volleyball) and throwing sports, particularly baseball pitchers. It is a stress injury that potentially can be a fracture (epiphysiolysis) of the proximal humeral physis. Most patients present with pain during or after throwing. There may be tenderness to palpation over the proximal humerus; if the athlete has been resting for a few days, examination may be normal. Radiographs should include comparison views to assess the physis. There may be widening of the proximal humeral physis in the affected arm, but the films may be normal. Treatment is rest from the offending activity, followed by a rehabilitation program designed to improve strength in the shoulder muscles. Pitchers should also be encouraged to follow youth pitching guidelines published by Little League baseball.

The elbow consists of three articulations: Ulnar-humeral jointRadial-humeral jointProximal radioulnar jointCollectively, these joints produce a hinge-type joint that allows for supination (palm up) and pronation (palm down) positioning of the hand. The elbow has excellent geometric stability, and the musculature around the elbow primarily produces flexion and extension.

Radial head subluxation is more commonly known as nursemaid’s elbow. Because the radial head is not as bulbous in infants and young children, the annular ligament that passes around it can partially slip off the radial head with traction across the elbow (Fig. 203-1). The subluxation is usually caused by a quick pull on the extended elbow when a child is forcefully lifted by the hand or when the child falls while holding hands with an adult. After a subluxation, the child usually holds the hand in a pronated position and will refuse to use the hand or move the elbow. Moving the hand into the supinated position while applying pressure to the radial head will usually reduce the injury. Usually, radiographs are not necessary unless reduction cannot be obtained or there is concern for fracture (swelling and bruising). Once the injury is reduced, the child will begin using the arm again without complaint. Parents should be educated about the mechanism of injury and encouraged to avoid that position. There is a high rate of recurrence for this injury. The problem generally resolves with

(From Rang M: Children’s Fractures, Philadelphia, 1974, JB Lippincott, p 121.) maturation, but some children with high recurrence rates may benefit from casting or, rarely, surgical intervention.

Panner disease is an osteochondritis of the capitellum (lateral portion of distal humeral epiphysis) that occurs spontaneously in late childhood. Clinical features include elbow pain, decreased range of motion, and tenderness to palpation over the capitellum. Radiographs reveal fragmentation of the capitellum. Treatment is activity restriction and follow-up radiographs to demonstrate spontaneous reossification of the capitellum over several months. There is usually no need for further treatment or imaging studies. This is not to be confused with osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, which usually will occur in adolescents involved with throwing sports.

The elbow is especially vulnerable to throwing injuries in theskeletally immature athlete. These occur from excessive andrepetitive tension forces across the radial aspect of the elbow andcompression forces across the lateral aspect of the elbow. Theseinjuries are commonly known as Little Leaguer’s elbow.

Although this injury is most common in baseball players who throw frequently (pitcher, catcher, third base, and shortstop), it also occurs in football quarterbacks and tennis players. Patients will usually complain of pain over the medial elbow with throwing that may last for a few days afterward. There may be associated swelling and lateral or posterior elbow pain. Radiation of pain may be secondary to ulnar neuropathy. There is often a flexion contracture of the elbow when compared to the opposite side. Palpation of the medial epicondyle, radial head, capitellum, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon process often reveals tenderness. Ulnar (medial) collateral ligament stability should be assessed. Radiographs should include the contralateral elbow for comparison. Radiographic findings in Little Leaguer’s elbow can vary and may include normal anatomy, medial humeral epicondyle apophyseal avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial head abnormalities, and foreign bodies in the elbow. MRI may be helpful.

Treatment depends on the underlying diagnosis but always includes pain control and rest from activity. Classic Little Leaguer’s elbow refers to medial humeral epicondyle apophysitis. These athletes benefit from rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medication, and a physical therapy program aimed at upper body strengthening. Throwing mechanics and the pitching guidelines published by Little League Baseball/Softball should be reviewed with these players. Switching players to a lower throwing position (e.g., first base) after rehabilitation, to avoid pitching for the remainder of the season, is often recommended.

Multiple small joints, a delicately balanced intrinsic muscle system, a powerful extrinsic muscle system, dense sensory innervation, and specialized skin combine to make the hand a highlymobile and sensitive yet powerful anatomic part. The extrinsicmuscles originate in the forearm and the intrinsic muscles arelocated in the hand and coordinate small, delicate movements. The movements of opening the hand, extending and spreading the fingers, and then clenching the hand into a fist requirescoordinated function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Tenderness of direct palpation of the bones raises the concern for fracture. Scaphoid fracture is the most common carpal bonefracture in the pediatric population. It requires immobilizationin a thumb spica cast, whereas displaced fractures require surgical intervention. Salter-Harris fractures of the distal radius are also very common. In young gymnasts, there is increased riskfor injury at the distal radial physis from repetitive impact andupper extremity weight bearing. This is commonly called gymnast’s wrist and requires absolute rest from impact and weightbearing to prevent premature closure of the growth plate.

Ganglion cysts are synovial fluid-filled cysts about the wrist. The most common location is the dorsum of the wrist near the radiocarpal joint, followed by the volar radial aspect of the wrist. The defect is in the joint capsule, which allows synovial fluid into the soft tissues with wrist use, where it can become walled off with fibrous tissue. Often, in skeletally immature patients, the process is benign and disappears over time. Large ganglion cysts or cysts that are painful and interfere with function may require more aggressive therapy. Aspiration and steroid injection into the cyst may be helpful, but many will recur. Surgical excision will remove the tract that attaches to the wrist joint, so it is usually curative.

Polydactyly (extra digits) occurs in simple and complex varieties (see Table 201-2). Skin tags and digit remnants that occur near the metacarpophalangeal joint of the fifth digit and thumb that do not have palpable bones or possess voluntary motion are simple varieties. These may be excised or ligated in the nursery. Complex deformities should be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for amputation. Syndactyly (fused digits) are concerning because of the possibility of shared structures and the tethering effects on bone growth (see Table 201-2). All patients with syndactyly should be referred for treatment options.

Trigger thumb and trigger finger are secondary to isolated thickening of the flexor tendons. As the thickened nodule enlarges, it may catch in a bent position, then snap or triggerstraight as it passes through the first pulley that anchors the tendon. Ultimately, as it enlarges, it cannot pass through at all and produces a flexion deformity at the interphalangeal joints. The nodule may be palpable near the metacarpophalangeal joint. These children should be referred for surgical correction.

Benign bone tumors and cystic lesions are common in childhood. Some represent fibrous dysplasia. Others are benign bone cysts (unicameral) or benign bone tumors (osteoid osteoma). Subacute osteomyelitis (Brodie abscess) and eosinophilic granulomas are lesions not associated with abnormal bone or cartilage growth. Some of these lesions can produce pain, limp, and pathologic fractures. Others can be incidental findings on radiographs. The prognosis is usually excellent. A brief differential diagnosis of bone tumors and their management is listed in Table 204-1. Malignant bone tumors are discussed in Section 21.
