Leadership in SurgeryStephen Markowiak, Hollis Merrick, Shiela Beroukhim, Jeremy J. Laukka, Amy Lightner, Munier Nazzal,  Lee Hammerling, James R. Macho, and F. Charles Brunicardi 1chapterINTRODUCTIONThe field of surgery has evolved greatly from its roots, and sur-gical practice now requires the mastery of modern leadership principles and skills as much as the acquisition of medical knowledge and surgical technique. Historically, surgeons took sole responsibility for their patients and directed proceedings in the operating room with absolute authority, using a command-and-control style of leadership. Modern surgical practice has now evolved from single provider–based care toward a team-based approach, which requires collaborative leadership skills. Surgical care benefits from the collaboration of surgeons, anes-thesiologists, internists, radiologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, therapists, hospital staff, and administrators. Occupying a central role on the healthcare team, surgeons1 have the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce medical errors, and improve patient satisfaction through their leadership of the multidisciplinary team. Thus, in the landscape of modern healthcare systems, it is imperative that surgical training programs include formal instruction on leadership principles and skills to cultivate their trainees’ leadership capabilities.Many medical and surgical communities, including residency training programs, acknowledge the need for improved physician leadership. Specifically, surveyed surgical residents felt a lack of confidence in multiple areas of leadership, particularly in conflict resolution.2 Surgical trainees identify leadership skills as important, but they report themselves as “not competent” or “minimally competent” in this regard.2,3 While a small number of surgical training programs have implemented 1formal curricula focused on teaching leadership principles, it is now imperative that all surgical training programs teach these important skills to their trainees.4,5 Interviews of academic chairpersons identified several critical leadership success factors,6 including mastery of visioning, communication, change management, emotional intelligence, team building, business skills, personnel management, and systems thinking. These chairpersons stated that the ability of emotional intelligence was “fundamental to their success and its absence the cause of their failures,” regardless of medical knowledge.6 Thus, residency programs need to include leadership training to prepare future surgeons for success in modern healthcare delivery.In the United States, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has established six core competencies—patient care, medical knowledge, prac-tice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and com-munication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice (Table 1-1)4—that each contain principles of leadership. The ACGME has mandated the teaching of these core competencies but has not established a formal guide on how to teach the lead-ership skills described within the core competencies. Therefore, this chapter offers a review of fundamental principles of leader-ship and an introduction of the concept of a leadership training program for future surgeons.DEFINITIONS OF LEADERSHIPMany different definitions of leadership have been described. Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter once observed that “A leader takes people where they want to go.

In business, the processes of customer satisfaction, product development, and organization efficiency are the equiva-lent of patient satisfaction, medical advancement, and efficient delivery of care. Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, studied the success and leadership styles of Fortune 500 companies over a 30-year period. He found that leadership is strongly correlated with corporate success, and most importantly for our study, that leadership strength can be broken down by level and characteristic  (See figure 1-1).8Of 11 particularly outstanding organizations identified, great leadership was the single major defining characteristic that distinguished them from their peers. These organizations were led by what Collins called the “Level 5 Leader,” one whose per-sonal humility and professional will drove team success. Under this system of leadership study, surgeon-leaders begin at the bottom level and, through study, hard work, and professional development, advance to the ultimate level of leadership.8FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEADERSHIPLeadership is a complex concept. Surgeons should strive to adopt leadership qualities that provide the best outcomes for their patients, based on the following fundamental principles: vision, willingness, time management, conflict resolution, where they don’t necessarily want to go, but where they ought to be.” Leadership does not always have to come from a position of authority. Former American president John Quincy Adams stated, “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.” Another defini-tion is that leadership is the process of using social influence to enlist the aid and support of others in a common task.7Levels of LeadershipWhen working toward organizational success, strong leader-ship is a critical component.

Surgeon-leaders will develop a team of faculty, residents, and other healthcare per-sonnel who are aligned on mission, vision, and values. The team and leader must be willing to address complex problems with honest communication and well-developed conflict resolution skills. A culture must be established where faculty and staff will work towards the advancement of the medical arts and the greater good of society.9VisionThe first and most fundamental principle of leadership is to establish a vision that people can live up to, thus providing direction and purpose to the constituency. Creating a vision is a declaration of the near future that inspires and conjures motivation.10 A classic example of a powerful vision that held effective impact is President Kennedy’s declaration in 1961 that “. . . this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” Following his declaration of this vision with a timeline to achieve it, the United Sates mounted a remarkable unified effort, and by the end of the decade, Neil Armstrong took his famous walk and the vision had been accomplished (Fig. 1-2).On a daily basis, surgeons are driven by a powerful vision: the vision that our surgical care will improve patients’ lives. The great surgical pioneers, such as Hunter, Lister (Fig. 1-3), Halsted, von Langenbeck, Billroth, Kocher (Fig. 1-4), Carrel, Gibbon, Blalock, Wangensteen, Moore, Rhoads, Huggins, Murray, Kountz, Longmire, Starzl, and DeBakey (Fig. 1-5), each possessed a vision that revolutionized the field of surgery. In the 19th century, Joseph Lister changed the practice of surgery with his application of Pasteur’s germ theory. He set a young boy’s open compound leg fracture, a condition with a 90% mortality 2Figure 1-2. Apollo 11 Lunar Module moon walk. Astronaut Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin walks by the footpad of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, July 1969.

(Used with permission from Getty Images.)rate at that time, using carbolic acid dressings and aseptic surgical technique. The boy recovered, and Lister gathered nine more patients. His famous publication on the use of aseptic technique introduced the modern era of sterile technique. Emil Theodor Kocher was the first to master the thyroidectomy, thought to be an impossible operation at the time, and went on to perform thousands of thyroidectomies with a mortality of less than 1%. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1909 for describing the thyroid’s physiologic role in metabolism. Michael E. DeBakey’s powerful vision led to the development of numerous groundbreaking procedures that helped pioneer the field of cardiovascular surgery. For example, envisioning an artificial artery for arterial bypass operations, Dr. DeBakey invented the Dacron graft, which has helped millions of patients suffering from vascular disease and enabled the development of endovascular surgery. Dr. Frederick Banting, the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, had a vision to discover the biochemical link between diabetes and glucose homeostasis. His vision and perseverance led to the discovery of insulin.11 In retrospect, the power and clarity of their visions were remarkable, and their willingness and dedication were inspiring. By studying their careers and accomplishments, surgical trainees can be inspired by the potential impact of a well-developed vision.Table 1-2The fundamental principles of leadershipLEADERSHIP SKILLDESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINEVisionThe act of establishing tangible goals of care for patients on both a daily basis as well as for long-term purposes.Effective communicationEstablishing an open, respectful, and nonjudgmental forum for communication among different members of the healthcare team and with the patient.Willingness to leadTaking on full responsibility for the care of patients and remaining ethical, professional, and committed despite the especially challenging rigors of joining the field of surgery.Willingness to learnA commitment to lifelong learning of the latest scientific, medical, and surgical updates to deliver optimized patient care.Conflict resolutionThe art of resolving conflicts in a peaceful and ethical manner in team settings.Brunicardi_Ch01_p0001-p0026.indd   529/01/19   10:58 AM 6BASIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IFigure 1-5. Michael E. DeBakey. (Reproduced with permission from AP Photo/David J. Phillip. © 2018 The Associated Press.)Generating Belief in Your VisionSurgical leaders with great visions will inevitably require help from colleagues, other healthcare professionals, scientists, administrators, patients, and nonmedical personnel. To get this help, surgical leaders must inspire their team and understand motivation. For the surgeon-leader, it is critical to know that people do not follow leaders because of what they do; people follow leaders because of why they do what they do. The people who help the leader execute the vision are motivated by the leader’s beliefs and attitudes more than the leader’s policy or agenda. This concept, based on Simon Sinek’s Start With Why, is rooted in understanding of the anatomy and function of the human brain.13 See figure 1-6.For example, take a surgeon-leader who wants to imple-ment a new perioperative checklist to reduce surgical errors. The “what” is very simple: a checklist to reduce errors. The operating room team may make a rational decision to adapt the checklist; however, it is also possible that the checklist may be perceived as “another piece of paperwork” and rejected, or that the checklist may have its implementation fought, undermined, delayed, or ignored. A surgeon-leader who does not understand how people are motivated might argue rationally, telling the team that the checklist was created with great care, that all of the best evidence was incorporated in its creation, and that the checklist is short and efficient. This is the “how,” and once again it appeals to the rational and analytical side of the team. With these arguments, the surgeon-leader’s vision remains susceptible to rejection for many of the same reasons. A leader who understands how to motivate a team towards a vision will start with “why.” Before ever discussing the checklist in detail with the team, the leader will speak of their shared mission to offer the best patient care possible, ask the team to imagine how they might want a family member treated, and emphasize that a careless error could lead to patient harm and embarrassment for the team. With these argu-ments, which constitute an emotional appeal to the team’s belief system, the leader can expect this vision for better patient care via a new surgical checklist to be adapted by the team. The team will be receptive to implementing a new checklist, not because they believe in the checklist as a tool, but because they believe in the surgeon-leader’s vision for optimizing patient care.There is a biological reason why this concept works. “Why,” “how,” and “what” are correlated to the functions Figure 1-4. Emil Theodor Kocher. (Reproduced with permission from the National Library of Medicine.)Leaders must learn to develop a vision to provide direction for their team. The vision can be as straightforward as provid-ing quality of care or as lofty as defining a new field of sur-gery, such as atomic surgery and personalized medicine. One can start developing such vision by brainstorming the answers to two simple questions: “Which disease needs to be cured?” and “How can it be cured?”12 The answers represent a vision and should be recorded succinctly in a laboratory notebook or journal. Committing pen to paper enables the surgical trainee to define his or her vision in a manner that can be shared with others.WhatHowWhyNeocortexLimbic BrainWhen a leader's vision appeals to “why,” it triggers an emotional response in the limbic brain and increases the likelihood that a vision will be embraced. Persuasion using “what” and “how” appeals to the neocortex and is more easily rejected.Figure 1-6. When leaders seek to generate belief in their vision, it is best to appeal to the team with “why” statements. (Data from Sinek S. Start with why: how great leaders inspire everyone to take action. London: Portfolio/Penguin; 2013.)Brunicardi_Ch01_p0001-p0026.indd   629/01/19   10:58 AM 7LEADERSHIP IN SURGERYCHAPTER 1of separate anatomical levels in the human brain. The neo-cortex is, evolutionarily, the newest area of our brains, and it is responsible for the analytical and rational thoughts and decisions that we make. It corresponds to the “what” and the “how.” When the surgeon-leader in the previous example started with the checklist and its rational arguments, the leader was appealing to their team’s neocortex, and the vision was rejected. However, when the surgeon started with the “why,” the vision for better patient care was emotionally accepted by the team, who became receptive to the checklist as a tool for achieving the vision.13Surgery is a field that requires extraordinary dedication and great personal sacrifice. The very nature of vision—steps forward into a better future—implies that change and difficult work will be required of the leader. See figure 1-7. For this reason, surgeon-leaders should establish visions about which they are deeply pas-sionate and committed so that when obstacles are encountered the leader has the strength of will to progress forward. Leaders should be selective about which options they pursue. Each oppor-tunity and idea requires great effort to execute; ultimately only aINFO:__main__:Test mode: Skipping actual training loop logic (or running dry run if needed).
